# Newsletter Structure (Substack)

Platform-specific structure and conventions for writing newsletter issues on Substack. Voice rules are handled separately by the `writing:voice` skill — this file covers structure only.

## Issue Structure

A standard newsletter issue follows this flow:

### 1. Opening Hook (1-2 paragraphs)

Jump straight into the topic. No preamble, no "welcome back" formulas. The opening should either:
- State a bold claim or finding
- Share a personal experience that sets up the topic
- Reference a timely event or announcement

The first sentence should make the reader want to read the second sentence.

### 2. Main Content (3-4 sections)

Each section covers one aspect of the topic. Sections are self-contained but build on each other.

**Per section:**
- Functional header (descriptive, not clickbait)
- 2-4 paragraphs of explanation
- Supporting evidence: personal experience, screenshots, code snippets, data
- Brief transition to next section (can be implicit)

**Section ordering:** Follow "why before how" — establish motivation before mechanics. Typical flow:
1. Why this matters / what problem it solves
2. What it is / how it works
3. Real-world example with specifics
4. Tradeoffs and counterpoints

### 3. Call-to-Action (1 paragraph)

One primary CTA at the end. Keep it natural — not salesy.

Common CTA types:
- Subscribe/share the newsletter
- Check out a related resource (video, guide, tool)
- Reply with thoughts or questions
- Try the tool/technique discussed

### 4. Sign-Off

Brief, forward-looking. Tease what's coming next or what to watch for. No "In conclusion" summaries.

## Soft CTAs

Weave 1-2 soft CTAs into the body content (not just at the end). These are natural mentions, not interruptions:
- "I covered this in more detail in [previous issue/video]"
- "If you want to try this yourself, here's the link"
- "I put together a guide on this — link below"

## Length Guidelines

| Issue Type | Word Count | Sections |
|---|---|---|
| Full deep-dive | 1,500-3,000 words | 3-4 main sections |
| Quick update | 500-800 words | 1-2 focused sections |
| Roundup/listicle | 1,000-2,000 words | 5-8 short items |

---

## Subject Lines

- 5-10 words, curiosity-driven
- State the topic or finding, not a vague tease
- Align with preview text (first line of the issue)
- No ALL CAPS, no excessive punctuation
- Examples: "Agent Teams: First Impressions After a Week", "The Claude Code Feature Nobody's Talking About"

---

## Formatting Conventions (Substack-specific)

- **Headers:** H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- **Images:** Full-width screenshots with context captions
- **Code blocks:** Use Substack's code formatting for commands, configs, prompts
- **Links:** Inline links with descriptive text (not "click here")
- **Dividers:** Use horizontal rules between major sections sparingly
- **Subscriber-only content:** If using a paywall, place it after the first major section

---

## Kenny-Specific Patterns

- **Personal experience framing:** Every issue is grounded in "I tried this, here's what happened"
- **Tool/workflow demonstrations:** Show real setups, not hypotheticals
- **Screenshot evidence:** Include screenshots as proof, always with context
- **Counterpoint acknowledgment:** After any strong opinion, address the other side
- **Forward-looking close:** End with what's next, not a summary

---

## Common Mistakes

- Opening with throat-clearing ("Welcome back to another issue...")
- Sections that are all explanation with no supporting evidence
- Missing CTAs entirely
- Tidy summary conclusions
- Subject lines that don't match the content
- Walls of text without visual breaks (images, code blocks, lists)
