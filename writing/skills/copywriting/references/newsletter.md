# Newsletter Structure (Substack)

Platform-specific structure and conventions for writing newsletter issues on Substack. Voice rules are handled separately by the `writing:voice` skill — this file covers structure only.

---

## The Newsletter Arc

Every issue follows: **Hook → Context → Value → Close**

```
Subject Line       → Get the open
Preview Text       → Reinforce the open
Opening Hook       → Earn the first scroll
Context/Setup      → Make the reader care
Core Content       → Deliver the value
Close              → Drive action + anticipation
P.S.               → Secondary CTA or engagement prompt
```

The reader can bail at every transition. Each stage's job is to earn the next 5 seconds of attention.

## Issue Types

| Type | Length | Structure | When to Use |
|------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Weekly Tip** | 500-800 words | Problem → Solution → How-To | Default format, most issues |
| **Deep Dive** | 1,000-2,000 words | Concept → Breakdown → Application | New features, complex topics |
| **Case Study** | 800-1,200 words | Story → Lesson → Template | Sharing real results/workflows |
| **Template Drop** | 300-500 words + template | Brief setup → Copy-paste resource | Delivering a reusable asset |

**"One core idea" for Deep Dives:** A Deep Dive covers sub-topics, but they must all serve one central thesis. The test: can you state the issue's core idea in one sentence? "How Agent Teams work" is too broad. "Agent Teams can 5x your output, but the cost math only works for specific use cases" is a thesis that sub-topics all support. If a sub-topic doesn't serve the thesis, cut it or save it for another issue.

## Section Rules

### Opening Hook (1-2 paragraphs)

Jump straight into the topic. No preamble, no "welcome back" formulas. The first sentence should make the reader want to read the second sentence.

Pick ONE hook technique per issue. Rotate across issues for variety:

1. **Bold Claim** — strong, specific statement that makes the reader lean in
2. **Relatable Problem** — name a frustration the reader felt this week
3. **Counterintuitive Insight** — challenge a common assumption
4. **Specific Result** — lead with a concrete, personal outcome with numbers
5. **Personal Story** — start with something that happened to you

**Never:** Dictionary definitions. Throat-clearing ("In this issue, I'm going to cover..."). Background the reader doesn't need yet. Newsletter name or generic greetings.

### Preview Text (Subtitle)

The second line readers see in the inbox. Supports the subject line.

- Don't repeat the subject line — add new information or deepen curiosity
- Under 100 characters for full mobile visibility
- Subject + preview = a one-two punch

| Subject Line | Preview Text |
|---|---|
| "Stop giving your AI more context" | "Most people do this backwards. Here's what actually works." |
| "My exact CLAUDE.md template" | "Copy-paste this and watch your agent sessions improve overnight." |
| "The 30-minute system that ships features for me" | "I kick it off, walk away, and come back to working code." |

### Context / Setup (3-5 sentences max)

The bridge between the hook and the value.

**Pattern:** Name the problem → Show the stakes → Tease the solution

- **Why before how** — establish motivation before mechanics
- **Make it personal** — "you" and "your" language, connect to the reader's world
- **Keep it tight** — get to the value

### Core Content (3-4 sections)

Choose the structure that fits the content:

| Structure | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **Problem → Solution → How-To** | Tips, techniques, workflows |
| **Concept → Breakdown → Application** | New features, mental models |
| **Story → Lesson → Template** | Case studies, personal experiences |

**Per section:**
- Functional header (descriptive, not clickbait)
- 2-4 paragraphs of explanation
- Supporting evidence: personal experience, screenshots, code snippets, data
- Brief transition to next section (can be implicit)

**Section ordering:** Follow "why before how" — establish motivation before mechanics. Typical flow:
1. Why this matters / what problem it solves
2. What it is / how it works
3. Real-world example with specifics
4. Tradeoffs and counterpoints

**When a draft covers too many topics — pick the angle:**

1. **Most original finding** — something the reader can't get from the docs
2. **Most practical takeaway** — what can the reader do *today*?
3. **Most felt problem** — which sub-topic connects to a frustration the reader already has?

Everything else becomes supporting context or material for a follow-up issue.

### Close

Three jobs: reinforce value, drive ONE action, create anticipation.

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Forward Look** | Default for educational content — what's next, what's unresolved, what to watch for |
| **Reflection** | Connect the specific topic to a broader principle |
| **Challenge** | Give the reader something specific to try this week |

**Never:** "In conclusion..." or "To summarize..." (school essay). Repeating the article in bullet points. Vague inspiration without a next step. "And that's it!" or "Hope this was helpful!" (low-energy endings).

### P.S. Line

Many skimmers still read the P.S. — it feels like a personal aside. Use it strategically.

**Effective uses:** Engagement prompt ("Reply with..."). Social proof ("Last week's template was used by 200+ subscribers"). Soft CTA. Teaser for next issue. Personal touch ("I spent 3 hours testing this so you don't have to").

**Rules:** One P.S. only. 1-2 sentences. Conversational and off-the-cuff, even if planned.

### CTA — ONE Primary Per Issue

Multiple asks dilute all of them. Pick one:

| Type | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **Reply** | Building engagement | "Hit reply and tell me: what's the one workflow you wish you could automate?" |
| **Share/Forward** | Growing the list | "Know someone who'd find this useful? Forward this issue." |
| **Try it** | Actionable tips | "Try this with your next Claude Code session and reply with what happened." |
| **Read more** | Linking to deeper content | "I made a full video walkthrough — watch it here." |

**Placement:** Primary CTA at the close. Secondary CTA in the P.S. (can be a different type).

**CTA copy rules:** Use action verbs ("Reply," "Try," "Forward"). Be specific ("Reply with your biggest challenge" > "Let me know what you think"). Low-friction — the ask should take 30 seconds or less. Don't beg — confident, casual asks convert better.

---

## Soft CTAs

Weave 1-2 soft CTAs into the body content (not just at the end). These are natural mentions, not interruptions:
- "I covered this in more detail in [previous issue/video]"
- "If you want to try this yourself, here's the link"
- "I put together a guide on this — link below"

---

## Body Writing Rules

1. **One idea per paragraph.** Two ideas? Split it.
2. **1-3 sentence paragraphs.** 5+ sentences = wall of text on mobile. Single-sentence paragraphs are fine and add rhythm.
3. **Subheadings every 150-300 words.** Readers scan before they read — subheads let them jump to what interests them.
4. **Lead each section with the payoff.** Don't build up to the point — state the point first, then support it (inverted pyramid).
5. **Concrete over abstract.** "This saved me 2 hours on Tuesday" beats "this can save significant time."
6. **Show, don't just tell.** Include screenshots, code blocks, templates, or step-by-step instructions. The reader should be able to *do something* after reading.
7. **Acknowledge trade-offs.** Every tool/technique has downsides. Naming them builds trust and prevents "too good to be true" skepticism.

## Copywriting Techniques

Apply throughout the entire issue:

1. **8th-grade reading level** — short sentences, common words, direct language. Technical terms fine when domain-specific ("context window" is fine; "utilize" is not).
2. **One idea per sentence** — long compound sentences with multiple clauses force re-reading. Break them up.
3. **Cut filler words** — "really", "very", "actually", "basically", "just", "quite". Also: "in order to" → "to", "due to the fact that" → "because", "the ability to" → "can". Exception: keep conversational fillers that add tone ("pretty significant" is on-voice).
4. **Active voice** — "I found" not "it was found". Passive only when the actor doesn't matter.
5. **The "So what?" test** — after writing any claim, ask "so what?" If you can't answer it, the reader won't care. "Uses 7x more tokens" → so what? → "I burned through my daily limit in under an hour."
6. **Bucket brigade phrases** — "Here's the thing...", "But it gets better.", "Here's where it gets interesting.", "But there's a catch." Use sparingly — once every few paragraphs, not every transition.
7. **Specificity principle** — "A 5-issue project dropped from 2.5 hours to about 45 minutes" beats "It's much faster." Specific claims are more believable and more interesting.

## Formatting for Scannability

- **Bold key phrases** so scanners catch the main points
- **Bullet points** for 3+ items (keep each to 1-2 sentences)
- **Whitespace** — break up dense sections with line breaks
- **Code blocks** for anything technical (commands, JSON, prompts)
- **Screenshots** with a sentence of context explaining what the reader sees
- **1-3 sentence paragraphs** for mobile readability
- **Tables** for comparisons (features, before/after, pros/cons)

**F-pattern:** Readers scan in an F-pattern — they read the first line fully, scan down the left, and occasionally sweep right. This means: first sentence of each section matters most, subheadings on the left get seen by skimmers, bold at the start of paragraphs catches scanning eyes.

### Substack-Specific Formatting

- **Headers:** H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- **Images:** Full-width screenshots with context captions
- **Code blocks:** Use Substack's code formatting for commands, configs, prompts
- **Links:** Inline links with descriptive text (not "click here")
- **Dividers:** Use horizontal rules between major sections sparingly
- **Subscriber-only content:** If using a paywall, place it after the first major section

---

## Kenny-Specific Patterns

- **Personal experience framing:** Every issue is grounded in "I tried this, here's what happened"
- **Tool/workflow demonstrations:** Show real setups, not hypotheticals
- **Screenshot evidence:** Include screenshots as proof, always with context
- **Counterpoint acknowledgment:** After any strong opinion, address the other side
- **Forward-looking close:** End with what's next, not a summary

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Opening with throat-clearing | Start with the hook — context comes after |
| Sections with no supporting evidence | Anchor every point in personal experience with specifics |
| Missing or multiple CTAs | One primary at the close, one secondary in the P.S. |
| Paragraphs with 4+ sentences | Split. Single-sentence paragraphs add rhythm. |
| No subheadings for 300+ words | Add a subhead every 150-300 words |
| Tidy summary ending | End forward-looking — what's next, not what was covered |
| Over-polished prose | Leave raw edges. Kenny's voice thinks out loud. |
| Preview text repeats the subject line | Add new info that deepens curiosity |
| Subject lines that don't match content | Deliver on the promise |
| Walls of text without visual breaks | Use images, code blocks, lists |
