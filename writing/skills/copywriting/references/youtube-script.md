# YouTube Script Structure

Platform-specific structure and conventions for writing YouTube video scripts. Voice rules are handled separately by the `writing:voice` skill — this file covers structure only.

## Script Flow

### 1. Hook (5-15 seconds)

The hook extends curiosity from the title and thumbnail. It does NOT repeat them — it builds on them.

**Hook types:**
- **Bold claim:** State the key finding or result upfront
- **Curiosity gap:** Tease what the viewer will learn without giving it away
- **Demonstration tease:** Show the end result briefly before explaining how

The hook should make the viewer think "I need to see how this works."

### 2. Intro (15-30 seconds)

Brief context for the video:
- What the viewer will learn or see
- Why it matters (personal experience framing)
- Quick overview of what's coming

Do NOT: lengthy channel introductions, "smash that like button" up front, or extensive background before getting to content.

### 3. Main Content (variable, 3-5 sections)

Each section covers one key concept or step. Structure per section:

1. **State the point** (5-10 seconds) — What this section covers
2. **Demonstrate/explain** (1-3 minutes) — Show it working, walk through the concept
3. **Key takeaway** (5-10 seconds) — What the viewer should remember

**Section ordering:** Follow "why before how" — explain the motivation before the mechanics.

### 4. Transitions Between Sections

Brief recaps or bridges between major sections:
- "So now that we've seen [X], let's look at [Y]"
- "That covers [X]. The next thing I want to show you is..."
- Keep transitions under 10 seconds

### 5. CTA Placement

**Mid-roll CTA (around 40-60% mark):**
- Brief, natural mention
- Subscribe, check out related content, or try the tool
- 10-15 seconds max

**End CTA:**
- More detailed, tied to what the viewer just learned
- Can reference related videos, newsletter, or resources
- 15-30 seconds

### 6. Outro

Forward-looking close:
- What's coming next on the channel
- What to watch for in the space
- Tease the next video if relevant

No: "Thanks for watching!", tidy summaries, or extended goodbyes.

## Timing Guidelines

| Video Type | Total Length | Sections | Section Length |
|---|---|---|---|
| Educational deep-dive | 10-20 min | 3-5 | 2-4 min each |
| Quick tutorial | 5-10 min | 2-3 | 2-3 min each |
| Tool review/first look | 8-15 min | 3-4 | 2-4 min each |
| Comparison | 10-15 min | 4-6 | 1.5-3 min each |

Optimal length for educational AI content: **10-20 minutes**. Long enough to be thorough, short enough to maintain attention.

## Demonstration Patterns

Kenny's videos are demonstration-heavy. The pattern is:

1. **Show** — Screen recording of the tool/workflow in action
2. **Explain** — Narrate what's happening and why
3. **Show result** — Display the output or outcome
4. **React** — Brief personal reaction or assessment

When writing scripts, include clear markers for where demonstrations happen:
- `[DEMO: Show Claude Code running agent teams setup]`
- `[SCREEN: Display the config file]`
- `[RESULT: Show the output]`

---

## Script Formatting

- Write in natural speech patterns (contractions, casual phrasing)
- Mark section breaks clearly with headers
- Include timing estimates for each section
- Note where B-roll, screenshots, or screen recordings are needed
- Use `[PAUSE]` for natural breaks or emphasis moments
- Write for spoken delivery — read aloud to check rhythm

---

## Common Mistakes

- Hook that just restates the title
- Too much explanation before showing anything
- Sections that run over 4 minutes without a break
- No mid-roll CTA
- Ending with a summary instead of looking forward
- Script that reads well but sounds unnatural when spoken
- Missing demonstration markers
