# YouTube Community Post Conventions

Platform-specific structure and conventions for writing YouTube community posts. Voice rules are handled separately by the `writing:voice` skill — this file covers structure, templates, and platform-specific formatting only.

## Post Structure

Every community post follows a three-part structure:

1. **Hook** (first 1-2 sentences, under 288 chars) — curiosity, surprise, or bold claim
2. **Body** (optional, 100-200 chars) — context or details
3. **CTA** (final sentence) — question, poll, or link

**Total post length:** 150-400 characters optimal.

### The 288-Character Rule

The visible preview before "read more" is approximately **288 characters**. The hook MUST land within this space. If the first 288 characters don't compel engagement, the rest doesn't matter.

## Post Types

Choose based on engagement potential and purpose:

| Post Type | Engagement | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Poll** (text or image) | Highest | Audience research, content planning, engagement |
| **Video teaser/clip** | High | Pre-release anticipation |
| **GIF** | Medium-high | Personality, humor, reactions |
| **Image** | Medium | Behind-the-scenes, infographics, fan shout-outs |
| **Quiz** | Medium | Educational/niche audiences |
| **Text-only** | Lowest | Quick updates, conversational moments |

**Default to polls when unsure** — they have the lowest friction and highest engagement.

## CTA Patterns by Goal

| Post Purpose | CTA Examples |
|---|---|
| **Poll** | "Vote below — I'll make a video on whatever wins" |
| **Video promo** | "I break down exactly how in the video -> [link]" |
| **Engagement** | "What's your experience with this? Drop it below" |
| **Conversion** | "I use [tool] for this daily. If you want to try it: [link]" |
| **Commitment** | "If this poll hits [N] votes, I'll make it this week" |

Every post must end with an engagement prompt — no exceptions.

## Formatting Rules

### Mobile-First

72%+ of interactions happen on mobile:

- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)
- Line breaks between ideas
- No walls of text
- Front-load the most important information

### Tone

- Conversational, not corporate
- First person, direct address ("I" and "you")
- Match the energy of the channel's videos
- Authentic > polished

### Images and Media

- Image polls get more attention than text-only polls
- Up to 10 images per post
- Use images for behind-the-scenes, infographics, results screenshots

## The 3-Phase Video Cycle

Structure posts around each video upload:

| Phase | Timing | Best Post Types |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-release** | 1-3 days before upload | Teaser, topic poll, behind-the-scenes |
| **Launch day** | Same day as upload | Hook-first promo with video link |
| **Post-launch** | 3-7 days after upload | FAQ follow-up, key takeaway, related poll |
| **Between videos** | No active video cycle | Engagement poll, quick tip, personal update, hot take |

## Common Mistakes

Ranked by damage potential:

| # | Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Only posting "new video out" links | Lead with a hook — curiosity, result, or bold claim |
| 2 | Corporate/automated tone | Rewrite conversationally — "I" and "you", authentic voice |
| 3 | No engagement prompt | Every post must end with a question or CTA |
| 4 | Ignoring mobile formatting | Short paragraphs, 1-2 sentences, line breaks |
| 5 | Not replying to comments | Misses the 2-4 hour algorithmic boost window |
| 6 | Over-commercializing (>20% promo) | 80% engagement/value, 20% promotional max |
| 7 | Not checking Analytics | Use YouTube Studio to find what works and double down |
| 8 | Sporadic posting | Consistency (2-3/week) beats volume |
| 9 | Generic poll questions | Make them niche-specific or slightly provocative |
