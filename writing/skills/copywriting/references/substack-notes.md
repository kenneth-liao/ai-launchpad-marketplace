# Substack Notes — Structure & Conventions

Platform-specific structure and conventions for writing Substack Notes. Voice rules are handled separately by the `writing:voice` skill — this file covers **structure only**.

---

## What Substack Notes Are

Substack Notes are short-form posts within the Substack ecosystem. They function like tweets but reach a newsletter-reading audience — people who already subscribe or actively browse. This audience is warmer and more attentive than a random Twitter timeline, which means Notes can go deeper, skip context-setting, and reward specificity.

## Note Types

### 1. Single-Punch Wisdom

One powerful, quotable statement that stands alone.

```
[One powerful statement that stands alone]
[Optional: Brief supporting thought]
```

**Psychology:** Screenshot-worthy and highly shareable — readers save and repost statements that crystallize what they already feel but haven't articulated.
**Length:** 1–2 sentences.

### 2. Income Proof Story

Share results with a vulnerable beginning to build credibility.

```
[Starting point — vulnerability or struggle]
[Turning point — what changed]
[Results — specific numbers]
[Insight or encouragement for reader]
```

**Psychology:** Builds credibility through transparency — showing the full arc (struggle included) feels honest rather than performative.
**Length:** 3–7 sentences.

### 3. Pattern Observation

An "I've noticed..." insight that positions authority through observation.

```
[Hook: "I've noticed..." or "A pattern I see..."]
[Examples or numbered list of patterns]
[Why it matters or how to apply it]
```

**Psychology:** Creates authority through observation — pattern recognition signals expertise without self-promotion.
**Length:** 3–8 sentences.

### 4. Contrarian Statement

Challenge conventional wisdom with a clear alternative.

```
[Bold claim that contradicts common belief]
[Why conventional thinking is wrong]
[Better alternative or deeper truth]
```

**Psychology:** Creates cognitive dissonance — readers remember ideas that challenge their existing beliefs, even when they disagree.
**Length:** 2–6 sentences.

### 5. Problem → Solution

Identify a common issue, reveal the root cause, and offer a fix.

```
[Problem: "You don't have X because..."]
[Root cause explanation]
[What to do instead]
```

**Psychology:** Produces "aha moments" by revealing hidden causes — the reader feels they finally understand something that was frustrating them.
**Length:** 3–6 sentences.

### 6. Build-in-Public Update

Transparent progress sharing with real metrics and learnings.

```
[What you're working on]
[Specific metrics or progress]
[Learning, insight, or next step]
```

**Psychology:** Transparency builds trust and connection — readers feel invested in a journey they can follow in real time.
**Length:** 3–8 sentences.

### 7. List-Based Tactical

Actionable numbered or bulleted advice that readers can apply immediately.

```
[Hook: "How to X:" or "If you want Y:"]
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]
- [Specific action 3]
[Optional: Punchy closing insight]
```

**Psychology:** High perceived value — scannable structure signals density, and numbered items feel concrete and actionable.
**Length:** 4–12 sentences.

### 8. Vulnerable Personal Story

A personal moment or realization that creates deep connection.

```
[Personal moment or realization]
[Emotional impact or turning point]
[Universal lesson or takeaway]
```

**Psychology:** Deep connection through humanization — vulnerability invites empathy and makes the writer relatable rather than aspirational.
**Length:** 4–10 sentences.

### 9. Newsletter Teaser

A key takeaway from a newsletter issue paired with a link.

```
[Key takeaway or finding — standalone value]
[Brief context on why it matters]
[Link to the full piece]
```

**Psychology:** Drives reads by delivering standalone value first — readers click because they want more, not because they were tricked.
**Length:** 2–5 sentences.

### 10. Direct Advice

Clear instruction with reasoning that removes ambiguity.

```
[Imperative: "Do this" or "Stop doing that"]
[Why it matters]
[What happens if you follow or ignore this]
```

**Psychology:** Clear guidance removes ambiguity — readers value directness when backed by reasoning they can evaluate.
**Length:** 2–5 sentences.

## Goal-to-Type Mapping

| Goal | Recommended Types |
|---|---|
| Teaching | List-Based Tactical, Problem → Solution |
| Building Authority | Pattern Observation, Income Proof Story |
| Connection | Vulnerable Personal Story, Build-in-Public Update |
| Quick Value | Single-Punch Wisdom, Direct Advice |
| Transparency | Build-in-Public Update |
| Positioning | Contrarian Statement |

---

## Length Tiers

- **Ultra-Short (1–2 sentences):** Maximum shareability, quotable wisdom. Best for Single-Punch Wisdom.
- **Short (3–5 sentences):** Quick insight with context. **MOST COMMON — default to this tier** unless the message demands more.
- **Medium (6–10 sentences):** Teaching or storytelling. Use for List-Based Tactical, Pattern Observation, or Vulnerable Personal Story.
- **Long (10+ sentences):** Deep dives, comprehensive frameworks. **RARE** — if you're writing more than 10 sentences, consider whether it should be a full newsletter issue instead.

---

## Universal Techniques

### Opening Techniques

1. **Bold Declarative** — A strong claim that demands attention. ("Nobody needs a morning routine.")
2. **Personal Admission** — A vulnerable or honest opening that disarms. ("I almost quit last month.")
3. **Pattern Observation** — Positions authority through noticing. ("I've noticed the best writers do one thing differently.")
4. **Direct Address** — Makes it about the reader immediately. ("You don't need another course.")
5. **Contrarian Hook** — Challenges a belief in the first line. ("Hard work is overrated.")

### Middle Techniques

1. **Numbered Lists** — Scannable, high perceived value. Break complex advice into discrete steps.
2. **Timeline Progression** — Shows transformation over time. ("Month 1... Month 6... Month 12...")
3. **Contrast/Comparison** — Before vs. after, right vs. wrong, old way vs. new way.
4. **Evidence Stacking** — Multiple examples that reinforce the same point from different angles.
5. **Cause → Effect Logic** — Clear progression from root cause to outcome.

### Closing Techniques

1. **Punchy Restatement** — Echo the opening in a memorable, compressed form.
2. **Actionable Implication** — Give the reader a clear next step.
3. **Open Loop** — Hint at more to come. ("I'll share how in this week's issue.")
4. **Quotable Wisdom** — A screenshot-worthy final line that stands alone.
5. **Encouraging Push** — Affirm the reader's ability to act. ("You already know enough to start.")

## Engagement Hooks

Every note should end with something that invites interaction. Types:

- **Questions:** "What's your experience?" "How do you handle this?"
- **Agree/disagree:** "Am I wrong here?"
- **Share request:** "If this resonates, share it with someone who needs to hear it"
- **Reply prompt:** "Drop your favorite [X] in the replies"

The engagement hook should be genuine, not formulaic. Vary the type across notes — repeating the same closer trains readers to ignore it.

---

## Cross-Promotion Patterns

Notes work well for connecting content across platforms:

- **Newsletter teaser:** Key finding + link to full issue
- **YouTube reference:** Interesting detail from a video + link
- **Guide/resource:** Quick tip from a guide + link to the full guide
- **Thread expansion:** A tweet that deserves more context

When cross-promoting, always lead with value — the note itself should be interesting even without clicking the link.

---

## Formatting

- **Minimal formatting:** Notes are inherently casual. Heavy formatting feels out of place.
- **Line breaks:** Use for readability, but fewer than LinkedIn — the audience reads longer form.
- **Links:** One per note. Place naturally, not as an afterthought.
- **Images:** Optional. Use when a screenshot or visual adds genuine value.
- **No hashtags:** Substack Notes doesn't use hashtags the way Twitter or LinkedIn do.

---

## Posting Cadence

- **Frequency:** 3–5 notes per week to maintain presence.
- **Timing:** Align with newsletter schedule — post notes on non-newsletter days.
- **Variety:** Mix note types. Rotate through the 10 types across a week.
- **Avoid:** Posting only teasers (feels spammy) or only hot takes (feels combative).

---

## Anti-Patterns

Five common failures with before/after demonstrations:

### 1. Vague Generalities

**Bad:** "Success takes time and hard work."
**Better:** "My first 6 months: $0. Month 7: $10K. Nothing happens, then everything happens."

Why it fails: Vague statements feel like filler. Specificity (numbers, timelines, concrete examples) is what makes a note worth reading.

### 2. Humble-Bragging

**Bad:** "So grateful for this little win" [shows huge number]
**Better:** "Made $50K this month. Here's the mistake that cost me $30K of it."

Why it fails: Readers see through false modesty. Leading with both the win and the cost feels honest.

### 3. Clickbait Without Payoff

**Bad:** "This one thing changed everything" [no specifics]
**Better:** "Switched from hourly to value pricing. Doubled my income in 8 weeks."

Why it fails: An unresolved promise frustrates readers. The payoff should be in the note itself, not behind a click.

### 4. Generic Advice

**Bad:** "Work hard and believe in yourself."
**Better:** "Wake up at 5am. Complete your hardest task first. Ignore everything else until noon."

Why it fails: Generic advice is unfalsifiable and therefore useless. Actionable advice is specific enough to disagree with.

### 5. Corporate Voice

**Bad:** "We're excited to announce our new offering."
**Better:** "Built something new. Tested it for 3 weeks. It works. Here's what it does."

Why it fails: Corporate language signals a press release, not a person. Notes are person-to-person.

## Examples

### Example 1: Pattern Observation

```
A pattern I've noticed in people who solve hard problems:

They don't start by googling solutions.

They sit with the problem. Write it down. Break it apart. Ask better questions.

Only then do they look for answers.

Most people skip straight to searching for solutions to problems they haven't fully understood.
```

### Example 2: Build-in-Public Update

```
Week 3 of building my content system:

Created 15 pieces this week. Took 6 hours total (used to take 20).

The secret: Templates + voice documentation + clear frameworks.

Still refining the process, but already seeing how this scales.

The system pays for itself in time savings.
```

### Example 3: Problem → Solution

```
You can't focus because you don't have a priority.

When everything feels important, nothing is important. Your brain doesn't know what to lock onto.

Solution: Pick ONE thing. Make everything else wait.

Clarity creates focus.
```

### Example 4: Income Proof Story

```
My first 6 months freelancing: $0.

Month 7: First client, $500 project.

Month 12: $3K/month consistent.

Month 18: $8K/month, booked out 3 months ahead.

It didn't click overnight. But once it clicked, everything moved fast.
```

### Example 5: Contrarian Statement

```
You don't need to hustle harder.

You need to sleep better, eat cleaner, and stress less.

Everyone's optimizing for more output. Nobody's optimizing for better inputs.

Your energy determines your results more than your effort.
```

## Common Mistakes

- Using Notes as a pure link dump ("New issue is up! [link]") — always lead with a standalone insight.
- Notes that are too long — if it exceeds 10 sentences, it probably should be a newsletter issue.
- No engagement hook — notes without a reason to respond die with no replies.
- Same format every time — rotate through the 10 note types to keep your feed varied.
- Ignoring replies — Notes thrive on conversation. Responding builds community.
- Over-promoting without standalone value — every note should be worth reading even if the reader never clicks a link.
- Treating Notes like tweets — the audience is warmer, the expectations are different, and the format supports more depth.
- Stacking multiple ideas in one note — one note, one idea. If you have three ideas, write three notes.
- Opening with "I just..." or "Just wanted to share..." — weak openings signal low confidence. Start with the substance.
