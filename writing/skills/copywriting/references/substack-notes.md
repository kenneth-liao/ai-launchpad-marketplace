# Substack Notes Conventions

Platform-specific structure and conventions for writing Substack Notes. Voice rules are handled separately by the `writing:voice` skill — this file covers structure only.

## What Substack Notes Are

Substack Notes are short-form posts in the Substack ecosystem. They function like tweets but within a newsletter-reading audience. The audience is already subscribed or browsing — they're warmer than a random Twitter timeline.

## Note Structure

### Simple Note (1 idea)

The most common format. One key idea, delivered concisely.

1. **Hook:** Opening line that captures attention (question, bold statement, observation)
2. **Body:** Brief expansion (2-5 sentences)
3. **Engagement hook or link:** Question, CTA, or link to full content

### Behind-the-Scenes Note

Share a glimpse into the process. Works well for building connection.

1. **What you're working on** (1-2 sentences)
2. **Interesting detail or finding** (2-3 sentences)
3. **Invite input** ("What would you want to see?", "Any questions on this?")

### Teaser Note

Promote a newsletter issue or other content without just posting a link.

1. **Key takeaway or finding from the content** (not "new post is up!")
2. **Brief context on why it matters** (1-2 sentences)
3. **Link to the full piece**

### Hot Take Note

Share an opinion that sparks discussion.

1. **The take** (clear, direct, 1-2 sentences)
2. **Brief reasoning** (2-3 sentences)
3. **Invitation to respond** ("Agree or disagree?", "What's your take?")

## Length Guidelines

- **Target:** 50-300 words per note
- **Sweet spot:** 100-200 words
- **Maximum:** 500 words (at this point, it should be a newsletter issue)

Notes should feel quick. If you're writing more than 300 words, consider whether it should be a full issue instead.

---

## Engagement Hooks

Every note should end with something that invites interaction:

- **Questions:** "What's your experience?" "How do you handle this?"
- **Agree/disagree:** "Am I wrong here?"
- **Share request:** "If this resonates, share it with someone who needs to hear it"
- **Reply prompt:** "Drop your favorite [X] in the replies"

The engagement hook should be genuine, not formulaic. Vary the type across notes.

---

## Cross-Promotion Patterns

Notes work well for connecting content across platforms:

- **Newsletter teaser:** Key finding + link to full issue
- **YouTube reference:** Interesting detail from a video + link
- **Guide/resource:** Quick tip from a guide + link to the full guide
- **Thread expansion:** A tweet that deserves more context

When cross-promoting, always lead with value — the note itself should be interesting even without clicking the link.

---

## Formatting

- **Minimal formatting:** Notes are inherently casual. Heavy formatting feels out of place
- **Line breaks:** Use for readability, but fewer than LinkedIn (the audience reads longer form)
- **Links:** One per note. Place naturally, not as an afterthought
- **Images:** Optional. Use when a screenshot or visual adds genuine value
- **No hashtags:** Substack Notes doesn't use hashtags the way Twitter or LinkedIn do

---

## Posting Cadence

- **Frequency:** 3-5 notes per week to maintain presence
- **Timing:** Align with newsletter schedule — post notes on non-newsletter days
- **Variety:** Mix note types (behind-the-scenes, teasers, hot takes, quick tips)
- **Avoid:** Posting only teasers (feels spammy) or only hot takes (feels combative)

---

## Common Mistakes

- Using Notes as a pure link dump ("New issue is up! [link]")
- Notes that are too long (should be a newsletter issue)
- No engagement hook (note dies with no replies)
- Same format every time (mix it up)
- Ignoring replies (Notes thrive on conversation)
- Over-promoting without standalone value
- Treating Notes like tweets (the audience and expectations are different)
