# LinkedIn Conventions

Platform-specific structure and conventions for writing LinkedIn posts. Voice rules are handled separately by the `writing:voice` skill — this file covers structure only.

## Post Structure

### 1. Hook Line (First 1-2 lines)

The hook line appears above the "see more" fold. It must compel the reader to expand the post.

**Hook patterns:**
- **Bold statement:** A strong opinion or surprising finding
- **Personal story opener:** "Last week I [did something unexpected]..."
- **Contrarian take:** Challenge industry conventional wisdom
- **Result/number lead:** Start with the outcome, then explain

The hook should create curiosity or resonate with a shared experience.

### 2. Body (Story/Insight)

The body expands on the hook with context, story, or explanation.

**Structure options:**

**Story format:**
- Situation (1-2 lines)
- What happened (2-3 lines)
- What I learned (2-3 lines)

**Insight format:**
- Context/observation (1-2 lines)
- Explanation (3-5 lines)
- Evidence or example (2-3 lines)

**List format:**
- Brief intro (1-2 lines)
- 3-7 items (1 line each)
- Brief closer (1-2 lines)

### 3. Lesson/Takeaway

Distill the post into one clear takeaway. What should the reader walk away with?

- 1-2 sentences
- Concrete and actionable when possible
- Not a platitude ("Work hard and good things happen")

### 4. CTA / Engagement Hook

End with something that invites interaction:
- A genuine question ("What's your experience with this?")
- An invitation to share ("Drop your best tip below")
- A simple agree/disagree prompt
- A link to a related resource (newsletter, video, guide)

## Tone Adjustments for LinkedIn

LinkedIn sits between Twitter's casual energy and a professional article. Adjustments from Kenny's default voice:

- **Slightly more professional:** Still conversational, but fewer sentence fragments
- **Industry context:** Reference broader industry trends, not just personal workflow
- **Audience awareness:** Mix of technical and non-technical readers
- **Still authentic:** Don't slip into corporate LinkedIn voice ("Excited to announce..." "Thrilled to share...")
- **No hashtag walls:** Quality over quantity

## Length Guidelines

| Post Type | Word Count | Lines |
|---|---|---|
| Quick insight | 50-150 words | 5-10 lines |
| Story post | 150-300 words | 10-20 lines |
| List post | 100-250 words | 10-25 lines |
| Long-form opinion | 250-400 words | 15-25 lines |

**Optimal length:** 150-300 words. Long enough to provide value, short enough to be read in full.

## Formatting Conventions

- **Line breaks:** Short paragraphs (1-2 lines). Single-line statements are common
- **Blank lines:** Use between every paragraph for readability on mobile
- **Emoji:** Sparingly as bullet markers or section dividers. Never as decoration
- **Bold/italic:** LinkedIn supports limited formatting — use for emphasis
- **Links:** One link per post, placed at end or in first comment
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 relevant hashtags at the very end of the post

---

## Hashtag Strategy

- Place all hashtags at the end, separated from content
- Use a mix: 1-2 broad (#AI, #BuildInPublic), 2-3 specific (#ClaudeCode, #AIAgents)
- No more than 5 total
- Only use hashtags that the target audience actually follows

---

## Engagement Patterns

**Best engagement drivers:**
- Genuine questions (not rhetorical)
- Contrarian opinions with reasoning
- Personal failure stories with lessons
- Behind-the-scenes of a process
- "Here's what I'd do differently" framing

**Avoid:**
- "Excited to announce" openings
- Humble brags disguised as lessons
- Motivational platitudes
- Engagement bait without substance

---

## Common Mistakes

- Opening with "I'm excited to share..." or "Big news!"
- Wall of text with no line breaks
- No engagement hook at the end
- Too many hashtags (more than 5)
- Corporate LinkedIn voice instead of authentic voice
- Posting a link with no context or commentary
- Being vague when specificity would be more compelling
