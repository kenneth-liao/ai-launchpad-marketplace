# Twitter/X Conventions

Platform-specific structure and conventions for writing tweets and threads on Twitter/X. Voice rules are handled separately by the `writing:voice` skill — this file covers structure only.

## Single Tweet

### Character Limit

280 characters per tweet. This is a hard constraint — every word must earn its place.

### Single Tweet Patterns

**Bold claim:**
> State an opinion or finding directly. No hedging in the tweet — nuance goes in the replies.

**Surprising stat/result:**
> Lead with the number or result, then brief context.

**Contrarian take:**
> Challenge a common assumption. The disagreement is the hook.

**Question:**
> Ask something the audience has an opinion about. Genuine curiosity, not rhetorical.

**Quick tip:**
> One actionable insight. Start with the action, end with the benefit.

## Thread Structure

Threads are 4-9 tweets that tell a complete story or explain a concept.

### Hook Tweet (Tweet 1)

The hook tweet determines whether anyone reads the rest. It should:
- State the topic and why it matters
- Create a curiosity gap or promise value
- Stand alone as an interesting tweet even without the thread

**Do NOT:** Start with "Thread:" or "A thread on..." — the content should speak for itself.

### Value Tweets (Tweets 2-7)

Each tweet in the body should:
- Make one point (not two or three crammed together)
- Be self-contained enough to make sense if retweeted alone
- Build on the previous tweet but not depend on it entirely
- Include specific examples, numbers, or evidence where possible

**Numbering:** Use numbers (1/, 2/, etc.) only if the sequence is truly sequential. For loosely related points, skip numbering.

### CTA Tweet (Final Tweet)

End with a clear next step:
- Link to the full resource (newsletter, video, guide)
- Ask for engagement ("What's your experience?", "What would you add?")
- Follow CTA if the thread provides standalone value

## Formatting

- **Line breaks:** Use blank lines between sentences for readability
- **Lists within tweets:** Use line breaks + emoji bullets or dashes for short lists
- **Links:** One link per tweet max. Place at the end, not in the middle
- **Images:** One image per tweet. Use for screenshots, diagrams, or results
- **Hashtags:** 1-2 max, only if genuinely relevant. Place at end, not inline

---

## Engagement Patterns

**Questions:** End tweets with genuine questions to drive replies
**Polls:** Use for quick audience research or engagement. 2-4 options, clear choices
**Quote tweets:** Add context or commentary to someone else's tweet. The added value should be clear
**Replies to own tweet:** Use for adding context, caveats, or links without cluttering the main tweet

## Thread Length

| Thread Type | Tweets | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| Quick insight | 3-4 | One idea with evidence |
| How-to | 5-7 | Steps with examples |
| Deep dive | 7-9 | Full topic coverage |
| Announcement | 3-5 | News + context + CTA |

Keep threads under 10 tweets. Longer threads lose readers.

## Common Mistakes

- Hook tweet that's too vague or generic
- Tweets that don't stand alone (require reading previous tweet to understand)
- Cramming too much into one tweet (split into two)
- Starting with "Thread:" or "1/" without a hook
- No CTA at the end
- Using hashtags inline instead of at the end
- Threads longer than 10 tweets
- Every tweet sounding the same (vary rhythm and structure)
