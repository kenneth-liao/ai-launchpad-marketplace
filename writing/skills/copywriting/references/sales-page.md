# Sales / Product Copy Structure

Platform-specific structure and conventions for writing sales pages, product descriptions, and promotional copy. Voice rules are handled separately by the `writing:voice` skill — this file covers structure only.

## Sales Page Structure

### 1. Headline

The headline does the heaviest lifting. It should combine curiosity with a clear benefit.

**Formula options:**
- **Benefit + Curiosity:** "Build AI Workflows 10x Faster (Without Writing Boilerplate)"
- **Problem + Solution hint:** "Stop Debugging Agent Configs — Here's a Better Way"
- **Result + Method:** "How I Automated 80% of My Content Pipeline with Claude Code"

**Guidelines:**
- Keep under 15 words
- State the benefit or result, not just the product name
- Avoid hype words ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Subhead can add specificity (1-2 sentences)

### 2. Problem Section

Paint the pain point the reader is experiencing. Make them feel understood before introducing the solution.

- Describe the specific frustration (not abstract)
- Use concrete scenarios ("You've spent 3 hours debugging a config that should take 10 minutes")
- Acknowledge what they've already tried
- 2-4 short paragraphs

### 3. Solution Introduction

Introduce the product as the answer to the problem. Keep it simple.

- What it is (one clear sentence)
- What it does for the reader (benefits, not features)
- Brief overview of how it works
- 2-3 paragraphs

### 4. Proof Section

Evidence that the product delivers. This is where credibility is built.

**Types of proof:**
- **Personal results:** "I used this to ship X in Y time"
- **Demonstrations:** Screenshots, screen recordings, before/after
- **Testimonials:** Real quotes from real users (with attribution)
- **Numbers:** Specific metrics, not vague claims

Include 2-4 proof elements. Each should be concrete and specific.

### 5. Feature Breakdown

Detail what's included. Structure as benefit-driven features, not a spec sheet.

**Format per feature:**
- **Feature name** (functional, descriptive)
- What it does for the reader (1-2 sentences)
- Brief example or screenshot (if applicable)

Keep to 4-8 features. More than that dilutes the message.

### 6. Call-to-Action

Clear, specific action the reader should take.

- One primary CTA (not three competing options)
- Action-oriented language ("Get started", "Download now", "Join the waitlist")
- Include what happens next (what they get, how quickly)
- Urgency only if genuine (limited spots, launch pricing)

### 7. Objection Handling

Address common concerns in FAQ format or inline.

**Common objections to address:**
- Price/value ("Is it worth it?")
- Time investment ("How long does this take?")
- Skill level ("Am I technical enough?")
- Risk ("What if it doesn't work for me?")

Keep answers brief and direct. 2-3 sentences per objection.

## Length Guidelines

| Copy Type | Word Count | Sections |
|---|---|---|
| Full sales page | 1,000-2,000 words | All 7 sections |
| Product description | 300-700 words | Headline, solution, features, CTA |
| Launch announcement | 500-1,000 words | Problem, solution, proof, CTA |
| Pricing page copy | 300-500 words | Value framing, features, CTA |

## Formatting Conventions

- **Headers:** Clear section headers, functional not clever
- **Short paragraphs:** 1-3 sentences, lots of white space
- **Bold:** Key benefits and important phrases
- **Bulleted lists:** For features and included items
- **Screenshots/demos:** As proof, not decoration
- **CTA buttons:** Distinct, repeated at strategic points (after proof, at end)

---

## Kenny-Specific Product Copy Patterns

- **Experience-first framing:** "I built this because I needed it" > "We created the ultimate solution"
- **Honest about limitations:** State what the product doesn't do, not just what it does
- **Show the workflow:** Demonstrate the product in a real scenario
- **No artificial urgency:** If there's no real deadline, don't manufacture one
- **Counterpoint included:** Acknowledge when the product might not be the right fit

---

## Common Mistakes

- Leading with features instead of the problem/benefit
- Vague claims without specific proof
- Multiple competing CTAs confusing the reader
- Hype language that erodes trust
- Missing objection handling (reader leaves with unanswered concerns)
- Too long — if the product is simple, the copy should be short
- No demonstration or visual proof
