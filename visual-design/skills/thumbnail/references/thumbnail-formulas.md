# Thumbnail Design Requirements

## Critical Requirements (MUST ALWAYS Follow)

### 1. Pass The Glance Test
The viewer must understand the thumbnail in 1 second or less.
- Full image must be comprehensible at a glance
- No mental effort required to figure out what is going on
- Test criterion: Would this be immediately clear when viewed at mobile size?
- If the viewer's eye has to search or study the image, it FAILS

### 2. Spark Curiosity
This is the #1 most important principle for clickable thumbnails.
- Create intrigue and tension in the viewer's mind
- Make viewers feel compelled to click to resolve the curiosity
- The thumbnail should make viewers want to know more
- Without curiosity, other principles will not matter as much

### 3. One or Two Clear Focal Points
The viewer's eye must be drawn to ONE point, or at most TWO points. Not multiple competing elements.
- NEVER create thumbnails with more than two focal points
- As soon as the eye needs to search for what to notice, it fails The Glance Test
- One dominant element should immediately grab attention

### 4. Mobile-First Design
Most viewers see thumbnails small. Design must work at small sizes.
- Always preview thumbnails at mobile/small size during design
- Important details MUST remain visible when thumbnail is small
- What looks good on a big monitor may fail on mobile
- Critical: Do not let important details get lost at small sizes

## Text Guidelines

### NEVER:
- Repeat the content title in the thumbnail text (viewer already has that information)
- Use too much text (breaks The Glance Test)
- Use text that is too small to read on mobile devices

### ALWAYS:
- Use text that complements (not repeats) the title
- Ensure text is large enough to read at mobile thumbnail size
- Keep text minimal and impactful
- Test text readability at small sizes

### Best Practice - Short, Punchy Text:
- Use brief, impactful phrases that describe the content
- Example: "10x OUTPUT" or "UNLIMITED USAGE"
- Exception: Slightly longer text is acceptable when there are minimal other elements and text takes up most of the space
- Text should be descriptive and add value beyond the title

## Visual Composition

### AVOID:
- Clutter (multiple competing elements)
- Images where nothing stands out
- Complex compositions that require study to understand
- Designs that take mental work to process

### PRIORITIZE:
- Clear, simple compositions
- High contrast elements
- One to two dominant subjects or elements
- Immediate visual clarity

### Performance Boosters:

#### 1. Eye-Catching Graphics and Colors
- Use bold, vibrant colors that stand out
- High contrast between elements
- Graphics should be visually striking and attention-grabbing

#### 2. People (Especially Faces)
- Faces perform exceptionally well in thumbnails
- Ideally feature someone relevant to the content
- Human faces create connection and draw attention
- Facial expressions can convey emotion and intrigue

## Hierarchy of Importance

1. **Spark Curiosity** - Without this, nothing else matters
2. **Pass The Glance Test** - Just as important; all other principles serve this goal
3. Focal points, mobile optimization, and text guidelines - All support the above two

## Evaluation Checklist

When evaluating or creating a thumbnail, ask:

1. Can I understand this in 1 second? (Glance Test)
2. Does this make me curious to learn more? (Curiosity)
3. At most TWO clear focal points? (Not multiple)
4. Does this work at mobile size? (Mobile-first)
5. If text is used: Does it complement (not repeat) the title?
6. If text is used: Is it short, punchy, and readable at small sizes?
7. Does it use eye-catching graphics and colors?
8. Does it feature people (ideally faces)?
9. Is the composition simple and uncluttered?
