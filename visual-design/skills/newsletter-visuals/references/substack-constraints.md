# Substack Newsletter Constraints

Platform-specific rendering constraints for visual assets in Substack newsletters. These constraints apply to all visuals generated by the `visual-design:newsletter-visuals` skill when the target platform is Substack.

## Aspect Ratios and Resolution

| Use Case | Aspect Ratio | Resolution | Notes |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Hero/header image | 16:9 | 2K | Also appears as email preview thumbnail and social share image |
| Inline diagram/chart | 3:2 or 16:9 | 2K | Must be readable at ~600px width in email |
| Comparison visual | 3:2 or 16:9 | 2K | Side-by-side layouts need width |
| Square illustration | 1:1 | 2K | Good for conceptual images that don't need width |

## Email Rendering Constraints

Images in email newsletters render differently than on the web:

- **Max display width**: ~600px in most email clients
- **Light backgrounds**: Always optimize for light backgrounds — dark-themed images look jarring in email. If the design system uses a light base (e.g., warm cream), this naturally works well.
- **Text size**: Text in images must be large enough to read at 600px display width
- **Fine details**: Avoid fine details that disappear at email scale
- **Thumbnail test**: Would this image make sense as a thumbnail? If not, simplify.

## Output Conventions

Save all generated images to the newsletter issue's episode directory:

```
episode_files/
├── visual-1-sequential-vs-parallel.png
├── visual-2-team-architecture.png
└── visual-3-cost-comparison.png
```

Use descriptive filenames that identify the visual's content, not its position.
