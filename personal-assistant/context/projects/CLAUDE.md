# Projects

`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ai-launchpad/personal-assistant/context/projects/` is your project system. 
`~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ai-launchpad/personal-assistant/context/projects/project_index.md` is the index of all of the user's projects.

## Project System Structure

There is only one file in the project system: `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ai-launchpad/personal-assistant/context/projects/project_index.md`.

## Usage

- Use the project index to understand the user's current projects or to find more information about a specific project the user has mentioned.
- Use filesystem tools (Read, Edit, Write, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep, etc.) to manage the project index.
- Keep the project index up to date and accurate.
