### Active Work
**Episode 20: Claude Code Context Engineering - THUMBNAILS COMPLETED ✅**

Successfully completed all thumbnail generation and finalization for Episode 20:

**Session Accomplishments**:
- ✅ Generated initial 3 color variations (yellow/orange, cyan/blue, matrix green)
- ✅ Regenerated with improved facial expression (satisfied grin vs shocked look)
- ✅ Created Fireship-style thumbnail (massive "CONTEXT" text, viral design)
- ✅ Created NetworkChuck-style thumbnail ("10x BETTER" with Claude logo)
- ✅ Iterated on facial proportions and logo accuracy
- ✅ Finalized 3 thumbnails for A/B testing with descriptive filenames
- ✅ Updated `2_plan.md` with complete thumbnail documentation and testing strategy

**Final Thumbnails Ready**:
1. `thumbnail_A_MAIN_fireship_context_text.png` - PRIMARY (Fireship-style, massive text)
2. `thumbnail_B_networkchuck_10x_better.png` - A/B TEST (multiplier hook, Claude logo)
3. `thumbnail_C_one_thing_gesture.png` - A/B TEST (original concept, gesture-focused)

**Location**: `/Users/kennethliao/projects/youtube/episode_files/20_claude-code-context-engineering/thumbnails/`

### In Progress
None - Episode 20 planning and assets complete, ready for production phase.

### Next Steps

**Production Phase** (When Kenny is Ready to Record):
1. **Pre-Production Setup**:
   - Prepare screen recording setup for Claude Code demos
   - Install/test claude-trace for observability demos
   - Create example CLAUDE.md file for demonstration
   - Gather code examples for context engineering techniques

2. **Recording**:
   - Record hook sequence (error → success) - 8 seconds max
   - Record 5 context engineering technique demos (CLAUDE.md, hooks, progressive disclosure, subagents, compaction)
   - Record claude-trace walkthrough
   - Record real-world example
   - Record talking head segments for intro/outro

3. **Post-Production & Publishing**:
   - Edit with text overlays and diagrams
   - Add timestamps/chapters
   - Publish with **Thumbnail A** (Fireship style) as primary
   - Monitor CTR for 24-48 hours, switch to B or C if needed
   - Target metrics: 14.5K+ views, 2.9%+ engagement, 50%+ watch time

**Complete production checklist available in**: `2_plan.md` lines 690-705

### Blockers
None - All planning and pre-production assets complete.

### Archive

**December 4, 2025 - Session 1 (13:00-13:45 PST)**:
- Completed Episode 20 video planning (research, title, thumbnail concepts, hook, outline)
- Created `1_research.md` and `2_plan.md` files
- Identified blocker: GEMINI_API_KEY not set for thumbnail generation

**December 4, 2025 - Session 2 (14:10-15:40 PST)**:
- Generated 3 initial thumbnail variations with color differences
- Iterated on facial expressions (changed from shocked to satisfied grin)
- Researched high-performing competitor thumbnails (NetworkChuck, Fireship)
- Created 2 new thumbnail concepts based on proven designs
- Corrected facial proportions and integrated real Claude logo
- Finalized 3 thumbnails with descriptive filenames
- Updated `2_plan.md` with complete thumbnail documentation and A/B testing strategy
- Episode 20 now 100% ready for production phase

## User Preferences

### YouTube Content Creation
- **Channel**: Kenny Liao (@KennethLiao, ID: UCOEqiv0-yg_hx0nJiaWJK4Q)
- **Audience**: Working professionals (non-technical to intermediate technical) interested in AI/Claude Code
- **Content Style**: Practical, result-oriented tutorials with real-world applications
- **Performance Benchmarks**:
  - Average Claude Code video views: 14,550
  - Average engagement rate: 2.99%
  - High performers use comprehensive guide format and personal assistant angles

### Decision-Making Patterns
- Prefers data-backed recommendations (research insights, competitor analysis)
- Values efficiency (parallel task delegation, structured workflows)
- Appreciates expert review and validation (used Thumbnail Reviewer agent)
- Selects options that balance: curiosity generation + proven patterns + audience fit

### Selected Preferences for Episode 20
- **Title**: "I Fixed My Claude Code By Changing One Thing (Not the Prompts)"
  - Chose personal discovery framing (resonates with audience per research)
- **Thumbnails**: 3 variations for A/B testing (all expert-approved)
  - PRIMARY: Fireship-style massive "CONTEXT" text (proven format, mobile-optimized)
  - A/B Test Option 1: NetworkChuck "10x BETTER" style (multiplier hook, attention-grabbing)
  - A/B Test Option 2: Original "one thing" gesture concept (personality-driven)
- **Hook**: Problem Amplification pattern (8 seconds, highest retention)

### Thumbnail Generation Learnings
- **Iterative approach works well**: Started with one concept, adapted based on proven competitor designs
- **Facial expression matters**: Prefers "satisfied grin" (normal-smile-looking-at-camera.png) over "shocked/mortified" look for confident, knowing tone
- **Accuracy important**: Required corrections for facial proportions (chin extended naturally, not recessed) and using real Claude logo (not AI-generated)
- **Proven patterns preferred**: Fireship and NetworkChuck styles analyzed from high-performing videos (674K-1.9M views)
- **Testing strategy**: Launch with text-dominant design (best mobile readability), switch based on CTR data
- **Competitor research useful**: Downloaded actual thumbnails from NetworkChuck and Fireship to analyze winning patterns
- **Multiple reference images**: thumbkit supports multiple --ref parameters (e.g., headshot + logo)

## Projects

### YouTube Channel: Kenny Liao
- **Current Episode**: 20 (Claude Code Context Engineering)
- **Episode Status**: ✅ Planning complete, ✅ Thumbnails finalized, Ready for production
- **Recent Episodes**:
  - Episode 19: "These 2 Tools Will Change How You Use Claude Code Forever" (11.2K views, introduced claude-trace)
  - Episode 18: Claude Code Plugins for YouTube Strategy
  - Episode 17: Personal Assistant with Claude Code (16.8K views, 3.32% engagement)
  - Episode 16: Claude Agent Skills (23.5K views - top performer)

### Episode 20 Details
**Topic**: Context Engineering and Observability for Claude Code

**Key Differentiator**: Only video teaching context engineering specifically FOR Claude Code (⭐⭐⭐ content gap identified in research)

**Content Gap Opportunity**:
- Competitors have 159K-169K views on general context engineering (Tina Huang: 4.27% engagement)
- Zero videos apply context engineering to Claude Code specifically
- Kenny's audience already primed (Episode 19 introduced claude-trace)

**Target Outcome**: Teach viewers how to optimize Claude Code's context window through:
1. Context engineering fundamentals (why it matters)
2. 5 practical techniques (CLAUDE.md, hooks, progressive disclosure, subagents, compaction)
3. Observability with claude-trace
4. Real-world example

**Success Criteria**:
- Viewers can define context engineering
- Viewers have 3-5 actionable techniques to implement
- Viewers know how to debug with claude-trace

### Tools & Workflow
- **Planning**: Uses youtube-research-video-topic, youtube-plan-new-video, youtube-title, youtube-thumbnail, youtube-video-hook skills
- **Thumbnail Generation**: thumbkit CLI (requires GEMINI_API_KEY)
  - Command pattern: `thumbkit generate --prompt "..." --ref <headshot> --out-dir <episode_dir>/thumbnails --model pro`
  - Uses headshots from `/Users/kennethliao/projects/youtube/assets/kenny_headshots/`
  - Outputs to episode-specific thumbnails directory
- **Thumbnail Research**: Downloads competitor thumbnails using curl to research/analyze proven designs
- **Asset Locations**:
  - Headshots: `/Users/kennethliao/projects/youtube/assets/kenny_headshots/`
  - Logos: `/Users/kennethliago/projects/youtube/assets/icons_logos/` (includes claude-code-logo.png)
  - Templates: `/Users/kennethliao/projects/youtube/assets/thumbnail_templates/`
- **Episode Files**: `/Users/kennethliao/projects/youtube/episode_files/[episode_number]_[topic]/`
  - Structure: `0_idea.md`, `1_research.md`, `2_plan.md`, `3_script.md`, `4_publish.md`
  - Subdirs: `thumbnails/`, `assets/`, `videos/`, `research/` (optional)
