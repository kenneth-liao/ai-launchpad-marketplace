# Pre-Publish Checklist

Run through this checklist for every newsletter issue before presenting the final version. Each item should be verified against the actual draft content.

## Subject Line & Preview

- [ ] Subject line under 50 characters?
- [ ] Passes the stranger test? (Would you open this from someone you've never heard of?)
- [ ] Specific — not vague or generic?
- [ ] Preview text adds new info (doesn't repeat the subject line)?
- [ ] 3 subject line options generated with recommendation?

## Opening

- [ ] First sentence earns the second sentence?
- [ ] No throat-clearing or preamble before the point?
- [ ] Reader knows what's in it for them within 3 sentences?

## Body

- [ ] One core idea per issue (not trying to cover everything)?
- [ ] Every claim backed by personal experience or specific evidence?
- [ ] Subheadings every 150-300 words?
- [ ] Paragraphs are 1-3 sentences (no walls of text)?
- [ ] Includes something actionable (template, code, steps, or prompt)?
- [ ] Trade-offs and limitations acknowledged honestly?

## Close

- [ ] ONE clear primary CTA?
- [ ] Ends forward-looking or with a challenge (not a summary)?
- [ ] P.S. line included with a secondary ask or personal touch?

## Quality

- [ ] Voice applied? (`writing:voice` invoked and verified)
- [ ] Can the reader DO something they couldn't before?
- [ ] Right length for issue type?
- [ ] Filler words cut?
- [ ] Mobile-friendly formatting (short paragraphs, no wide tables)?
- [ ] Would you send this to a friend?
