# Social Post Headline Patterns

Headline patterns for Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Substack Notes optimized for scroll-stopping engagement.

## Core Principles

Social headlines compete in an infinite scroll. The first line must stop the scroll within a fraction of a second. Bold, specific, and unexpected beats safe and generic.

## Scroll-Stopping Formulas

### Bold Claim
- "Most AI agents are built wrong."
- "Nobody needs another chatbot."
**Works because**: Readers agree or disagree strongly. Both drive engagement.

### Contrarian Take
- "Stop learning new frameworks."
- "AI agents don't need memory. (Hear me out.)"
**Works because**: Contradiction creates cognitive dissonance that demands resolution.

### Surprising Stat or Result
- "I automated 80% of my workflow in 2 hours."
- "3 lines of code replaced 200."
**Works because**: Specificity creates credibility. Surprising numbers create curiosity.

### Personal Story Opening
- "I almost quit building AI agents last week."
- "The worst code review I've ever received taught me the most."
**Works because**: Vulnerability is rare in feeds. It stands out.

### Question Hook
- "What's the biggest mistake you've made with AI agents?"
- "Are you still building AI agents without memory?"
**Works because**: Questions trigger involuntary mental responses.

## Platform-Specific Adjustments

### Twitter/X
- 280 characters per tweet; thread opener must stand alone AND hook into the thread
- Lead with the boldest statement. Context comes in tweet 2.
- Avoid: Hashtag-heavy posts, "Thread:" prefix, generic greetings

### LinkedIn
- Only first 1-3 lines visible before "...see more"
- First line should be a hook; second line should deepen curiosity
- Avoid: "I'm happy to announce" format, overly casual tone

### Substack Notes
- Reader-focused, long-form audience expecting depth
- Share a single sharp insight; make it valuable standalone
- Avoid: Pure self-promotion, "New post!" without context

## Hook + Value Pattern

1. **Hook** (first line): Bold claim, question, or surprising statement
2. **Bridge** (second line): Brief context or "here's what I learned"
3. **Value** (body): The actual insight, framework, or lesson
4. **Call to action** (optional): Engage, follow, or read more

## Thread Opener Strategies (Twitter/X)

**Standalone Hook**: "I spent 100 hours building AI agents. Here's what I'd do differently."
**Curiosity Gap**: "The best AI agent I've built uses a pattern most developers have never heard of."
**List Tease**: "7 AI agent patterns I wish I knew a year ago (thread):"

## LinkedIn Hook Line Patterns

- "I got fired. Best thing that ever happened." (personal story + contradiction)
- "Stop building chatbots." (bold claim, 3 words)
- "Everyone is talking about AI agents. Nobody is talking about this." (contrarian)

## Anti-Patterns Across All Platforms

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|---|---|---|
| Generic greeting | "Hey everyone!" | Wastes the most valuable real estate |
| Self-promotion only | "Check out my new post!" | No value for the reader |
| Vague teasing | "Something exciting is coming..." | No curiosity gap without specifics |
| Hashtag spam | "#AI #agents #coding #tech" | Looks desperate, dilutes message |
| Thread prefix | "THREAD:" | Labels format, not value |
| Humble brag | "Humbled to announce..." | Inauthentic, overdone |
