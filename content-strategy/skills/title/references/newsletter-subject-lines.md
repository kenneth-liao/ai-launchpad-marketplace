# Newsletter Subject Line Patterns

Platform-specific patterns for email newsletter subject lines optimized for open rate.

## Core Requirements

Email subject lines compete in a crowded inbox. The subject line must create enough curiosity or urgency to earn an open within 1-2 seconds of scanning.

### Optimal Length
- **Target**: 5-10 words (28-50 characters)
- Mobile displays 30-40 characters; desktop displays 50-70 characters
- Every word must earn its place — no filler

## Subject Line Formulas

### Curiosity-Driven
- "I was wrong about AI agents"
- "The tool I almost didn't share"
- "This surprised me"

### Question Format
- "Are you making this AI mistake?"
- "What if your agent could remember everything?"

### Number/List Format
- "3 AI agent patterns worth stealing"
- "5 mistakes killing your automation"

### How-To with Twist
- "How I accidentally built a $10K system"
- "The wrong way to build AI agents (that works)"

### Bold Claim
- "AI agents are broken. Here's proof."
- "Stop building AI agents like this"

### Personal/Story
- "I spent 40 hours on this so you don't have to"
- "The email I almost didn't send"

## Preview Text Strategy

Preview text appears after the subject line. It is the second line of persuasion.

- **Complement, never repeat**: If subject is a question, preview should tease the answer
- **Add context**: Expand on the subject line's promise
- **Avoid default text**: Never let preview be "View this email in your browser"

| Subject Line | Bad Preview | Good Preview |
|---|---|---|
| "I was wrong about AI agents" | "I was wrong about AI agents and here's why" | "And it cost me 3 weeks of work." |
| "3 patterns worth stealing" | "Here are 3 patterns for AI agents" | "Number 2 saved me 10 hours last week." |

## Personalization Patterns

- Use the reader's name sparingly (overuse triggers spam filters)
- Reference their behavior when possible ("Since you read last week's issue...")
- Segment-specific subject lines outperform generic ones

## Urgency vs Curiosity Balance

- **Curiosity** works best for regular newsletters — builds a reading habit
- **Urgency** works for time-sensitive content — launches, limited offers
- Best practice: 80% curiosity-driven, 20% urgency-driven

## A/B Testing Strategy

- Test one variable at a time: subject line OR preview text, not both
- Minimum sample size: 500+ subscribers per variant
- Track open rate AND click rate — opens without clicks is misleading

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|---|---|---|
| Clickbait with no payoff | "You won't BELIEVE this" | Erodes trust, increases unsubscribes |
| ALL CAPS | "DON'T MISS THIS!!!" | Triggers spam filters, looks desperate |
| Excessive punctuation | "Wait... really?!?!" | Feels spammy, reduces credibility |
| Vague generics | "This week's newsletter" | No reason to open |
| False urgency | "LAST CHANCE" (when it is not) | Readers learn to ignore |
| Re: / Fwd: tricks | "Re: Your AI agent" | Deceptive, damages trust permanently |
