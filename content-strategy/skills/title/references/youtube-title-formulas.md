# YouTube Title Formulas

Platform-specific title patterns for YouTube video titles optimized for click-through rate (CTR).

## Core YouTube Title Requirements

YouTube titles compete in search results, suggested videos, and home feed. The title must work alongside the thumbnail to form a single cohesive "ad" for the video.

### Curiosity Generation (MANDATORY)

Every YouTube title MUST prompt a specific question in the viewer's mind. The curiosity gap must be strong enough to drive action. Titles must spark curiosity through implication, not just description.

### Thumbnail Complementarity (MANDATORY)

- Title text MUST NOT duplicate thumbnail text
- Title must align with the emotional tone or visual elements in the thumbnail
- Together, title + thumbnail must create a cohesive narrative that raises curiosity

## Curiosity Formulas for YouTube

### Mistake/Problem Framing
Implies the viewer might be doing something wrong.
- "Big Mistakes Small YouTube Creators Still Make!"
- "The AI Agent Pattern Nobody Talks About"
**Prompts**: "Am I making these mistakes?"

### Question Implication
Creates intrigue through ambiguity and unresolved narrative.
- "I Should Have Seen This Coming..."
- "They Didn't Believe Me Until..."
**Prompts**: "What happened? What was the outcome?"

### Extreme Behavior
Highlights unusual or extreme actions that defy expectations.
- "the GRILLED CHEESE I ate every other day for 2 years"
- "Offering People $100,000 To Quit Their Job"
**Prompts**: "Why would someone do that?"

### High-Stakes Scenario
Introduces risk, cost, or consequence to elevate urgency.
- "The AI Agent Mistake That Cost Me 10 Hours"
- "I Broke Production With This One Line of Code"
**Prompts**: "What went wrong? How can I avoid this?"

### Novel Perspective
Offers a unique or unexpected angle on a familiar topic.
- "What Nobody Tells You About Building AI Agents"
- "I Built This AI Agent Wrong (Here's What I Learned)"
**Prompts**: "What's different about this take?"

## Forbidden Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|---|---|---|
| Generic tutorial | "Python Tutorial for Beginners" | No curiosity, purely descriptive |
| Plain how-to | "How to Build an AI Agent" | Describes process, no intrigue |
| Simple description | "A Giant Root" | States content, raises no question |
| Generic promise | "Grow Your YouTube Channel" | Vague, no specific curiosity |

**Exception**: "How to [X]" works when paired with intrigue ("How I Accidentally Built a $10K/month AI Agent").

## Content Type Applications

### Educational Content (Tutorials, How-To)
Frame as mistakes, secrets, or unexpected discoveries. Imply value rather than stating process.

### Entertainment Content (Vlogs, Gaming, Challenges)
Use high-stakes or extreme behavior framing. Leave the outcome unresolved.

### Tech/AI Content
Lead with the problem or mistake, not the solution. Use specific numbers or consequences to create stakes.

## High-Performing vs Low-Performing Patterns

**High-Performing**: "Big Mistakes Small YouTube Creators Still Make!" | "I Should Have Seen This Coming..." | "Offering People $100,000 To Quit Their Job"

**Low-Performing**: "Grow Your YouTube Channel" | "A Giant Root" | "How to Make Grilled Cheese" | "Python Tutorial for Beginners"

## Thumbnail Complementarity Examples

| Thumbnail Shows | Bad Title (Duplicates) | Good Title (Complements) |
|---|---|---|
| Frustrated face + "Views: 17" | "Why I Have No Views" | "I Should Have Seen This Coming..." |
| "SECRET WEAPON" text | "My Secret Weapon for YouTube" | "This Changed Everything About My Channel" |
| Error message on screen | "I Got an Error" | "The Bug That Cost Me 10 Hours" |

## YouTube-Specific Length Guidelines

- Optimal: 50-70 characters (fully visible in most placements)
- Maximum: 100 characters (truncated on mobile)
- Avoid: Under 30 characters (looks thin, misses curiosity opportunity)
