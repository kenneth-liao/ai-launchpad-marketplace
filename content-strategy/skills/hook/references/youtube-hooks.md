# YouTube Video Hooks

Platform-specific hook patterns for YouTube video openings (first 5-30 seconds) optimized for viewer retention and watch time.

## YouTube-Specific Timing Requirements

### Critical Timing Rules

1. **Hook must occur within 5-15 seconds**
   - Optimal: 3-8 seconds
   - Absolute maximum: 15 seconds before delivering hook

2. **After hook (within first 15 seconds), THEN:**
   - Brief introduction acceptable (5-10 seconds max)
   - Transition to main content

3. **Main promised content must begin within 30 seconds**

## YouTube Algorithm Implications

**Opening seconds directly impact:**
- Early abandonment rate (negative ranking signal)
- Average view duration (positive ranking signal)
- Video surface probability in recommendations

**Patterns that cause quick abandonment:**
- Confusion (unrelated opening)
- Boredom (repetitive opening)
- Disappointment (mismatched expectations)

## Video-Specific Forbidden Patterns

### DO NOT Welcome Viewers Before Hook (FORBIDDEN)
- "Hi guys, welcome to my video, I'm Joe!"
- "Hello everyone and welcome back to the channel..."
**Why**: Doesn't build upon title/thumbnail momentum. Greetings are acceptable AFTER the hook.

### DO NOT Repeat the Title (FORBIDDEN)
- Title: "5 Photography Mistakes" -> "Today I'm showing you 5 photography mistakes"
**Why**: Viewer already has this information. Repetition drains attention.

### DO NOT Start with Unrelated Content (FORBIDDEN)
- Title: "Cat Tricks Tutorial" -> Walking down sidewalk talking about a new car
**Why**: Viewer confusion triggers abandonment. YouTube interprets as low-quality.

## Content Type Applications

### Educational Content (Tutorials, How-To)
- Show quick clips of the end result
- Jump into a preview or start teaching immediately
- FORBIDDEN: "In this tutorial I'm going to teach you..."

### Entertainment Content (Vlogs, Gaming)
- Lead with drama, excitement, or unexpected elements
- Start in the middle of the action
- Context can come after the hook

### List/Compilation Videos
- Show glimpses that create curiosity
- DO NOT list items by name in order
- "Wait until you see number 3..."

## YouTube Hook Pattern Examples

### Pattern A: Preview/Teaser
Title: "5 Photoshop Tricks" -> [3-second rapid montage of results] "You're about to learn all of these..."

### Pattern B: Intrigue Escalation
Title: "iPhone Hidden Feature" -> "Your iPhone has been hiding this from you..." [shows unexpected result]

### Pattern C: Problem Amplification
Title: "AI Agent Mistakes" -> "If you're building agents like this, you're wasting hours of compute."

### Pattern D: Immediate Value
Title: "Amazing Cooking Hack" -> [Shows hack in action immediately] "Watch this..."

## Success and Failure Comparison

**Success:**
Title: "The AI Agent Pattern Nobody Talks About"
Hook (0-8 sec): "I've built 30+ AI agents this year. Every single one uses this pattern — and I've never seen anyone else teach it."
*Why it works*: Escalates curiosity, connects to title, no greeting, no repetition.

**Failure:**
Title: "The AI Agent Pattern Nobody Talks About"
Hook (0-15 sec): "Hey everyone! Welcome back to the channel. Today we're going to talk about an AI agent pattern that nobody really talks about."
*Why it fails*: Greeting before hook, repeats title verbatim, no curiosity escalation.

## Priority Order for YouTube

1. DO NOT repeat the title (instant failure)
2. Extend curiosity beyond title/thumbnail
3. Connect directly to promised content
4. DO NOT welcome viewers first
5. Deliver hook within 5-15 seconds
