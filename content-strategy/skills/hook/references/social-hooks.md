# Social Post Opening Hooks

Platform-specific hook patterns for Twitter/X threads, LinkedIn posts, and social content.

## Social-Specific Requirements

On social platforms, the opening line IS the hook. Users scroll past content in under 1 second. The first line must create enough friction to stop the scroll.

- On LinkedIn, only first 1-3 lines show before "...see more"
- On Twitter, the first tweet of a thread must work as a standalone AND as a hook

## Twitter/X: Thread Opener Strategies

The opening tweet must function independently and create a curiosity gap into tweet 2.

**Bold Statement**: "I've built 30+ AI agents this year. Every single one uses the same 3 patterns. Here they are:"
**Story Opener**: "Last week I deleted 2,000 lines of AI agent code. My agents got 10x better. Here's what I removed:"
**Contrarian**: "Most AI agent tutorials teach you the wrong thing first. They start with prompt engineering. They should start with memory."

### Twitter Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|---|---|---|
| "Thread:" prefix | "THREAD: AI Best Practices" | Labels format, not value |
| "1/" numbering lead | "1/ Let's talk about AI" | No curiosity, signals effort |
| Generic greeting | "Hey everyone! Quick thread..." | Wastes valuable characters |
| Hashtag-first | "#AIAgents #Thread" | Looks like spam |

## LinkedIn: Hook Line Patterns

Only the first 1-3 lines are visible. The hook must make the reader click "see more."

**Short Bold Claim**: "Stop building chatbots. (I know that sounds extreme. Let me explain.)"
**Personal Vulnerability**: "I got rejected from 47 job applications last month. Here's what I learned:"
**Counterintuitive Result**: "I deleted my to-do list 6 months ago. I've never been more productive."
**Surprising Number**: "3 lines of code replaced 200 in my AI agent. Here's the pattern:"

### LinkedIn Anti-Patterns
- "I'm happy to announce" — Overdone, no curiosity
- Corporate speak — Jargon repels engagement
- "Humbled to share" — Inauthentic, readers see through it

## Scroll-Stopping First Lines (All Platforms)

- **Self-assessment question**: "Are you still building AI agents without memory?"
- **"I was wrong" admission**: "I was wrong about AI agents for two years."
- **Unexpected result**: "One config change cut my API costs by 90%."
- **Counterintuitive advice**: "Stop optimizing your prompts."
- **Time-pressure**: "This took me 6 months to figure out. Read it in 2 minutes."

## Thread vs Single Post

**Thread when**: 3+ distinct points that build on each other, topic exceeds one tweet
**Single post when**: Insight is sharp and complete in one shot, maximum shareability needed

### Thread Structure
1. Hook (standalone value + curiosity gap)
2. Context or first point
3. Value delivery (one point per tweet)
4. Summary + call to action

## Universal Anti-Patterns

1. **Starting with "So..."** — Weak filler that wastes the first word
2. **Asking permission** — "Can I share something?" Just share it.
3. **Meta-commentary** — "I don't usually post about this but..." Get to the point.
4. **Apologetic framing** — "This might be obvious but..." Undermines value.
5. **Throat-clearing** — "I've been thinking a lot lately about..." Start with the thought.
