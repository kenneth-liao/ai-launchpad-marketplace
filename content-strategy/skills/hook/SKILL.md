# Hook Creation

## Overview

This skill provides concrete requirements and proven patterns for creating opening hooks that retain audience attention, extend title/headline curiosity, and maximize engagement. The opening content is critical for retention across all platforms — video, email, and social.

**Core Principle**: The opening must EXTEND the curiosity created by the title/headline, not repeat or waste it. The audience already engaged based on the title's promise. The opening must ADD new intrigue and make them MORE interested.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Planning new content and need to design the opening hook
- Reviewing an existing opening for engagement optimization
- The user asks for help with retention, early drop-off, or opening strategy
- Creating content that requires strong audience engagement from the start
- Analyzing why content has poor early engagement metrics

## Content Type Resolution

Before creating hooks, determine the content type and load the appropriate platform-specific reference file:

| Content Type | Reference File | Opening Format |
|---|---|---|
| YouTube video | `references/youtube-hooks.md` | First 5-15 seconds of video |
| Newsletter | `references/newsletter-hooks.md` | First paragraph / preview text |
| Social post | `references/social-hooks.md` | First line / hook tweet |

**MANDATORY**: Read the relevant reference file before creating hooks. These references contain platform-specific patterns, timing requirements, and forbidden patterns.

If the content type does not match any reference file, apply the universal principles below and adapt to the format.

## Critical Requirements

### 1. Curiosity Extension (CRITICAL)

Opening content MUST build upon the intrigue from the title/headline, never repeat it.

**CORRECT Example:**
- Title: "Teach Your Cat 5 Tricks in 10 Minutes"
- Opening: Rapid preview montage of impressive tricks in action
- Audience thinks: "I can teach my cat ALL of that in only 10 minutes?!"

**INCORRECT Example:**
- Title: "Teach Your Cat 5 Tricks in 10 Minutes"
- Opening: "Today we're going to look at 5 tricks you can teach your cat in 10 minutes"
- Audience thinks: "I know. Get on with it."

The opening must make the audience MORE interested than when they engaged. Attention must INCREASE, not drain.

### 2. Direct Content Connection (MANDATORY)

Opening content MUST directly relate to the title/headline promise.

**Rules:**
- NO unrelated tangents or side stories in the opening
- NO delayed starts where main content appears much later
- Content must be tightly connected to the promised value
- If additional context is needed, it must come AFTER the hook is established

### 3. Forbidden Opening Patterns

These patterns are DISQUALIFYING violations across all content types:

#### 3.1 DO NOT Repeat the Title (FORBIDDEN)

Never restate what the title already communicated. The audience already has this information. Repetition drains attention.

#### 3.2 DO NOT Greet Before Hooking (FORBIDDEN)

Never start with greetings, welcomes, or introductions before the hook. Greetings are acceptable AFTER the initial hook is established.

- Bad: "Hi everyone, welcome back..."
- Bad: "Hey what's up, thanks for clicking..."
- Bad: "In this issue, we'll cover..."

#### 3.3 DO NOT Start with Unrelated Content (FORBIDDEN)

Never open with tangents, stories, or content disconnected from the title/headline promise. Audience confusion triggers abandonment.

## Effective Opening Hook Patterns

Use one of these proven hook structures:

### Pattern A: Preview/Teaser

Show a brief glimpse of the payoff before diving into the full content.

**Creates thought**: "I need to know how to do that!" or "I need to read this."

Works best for: Educational content, tutorials, how-to guides.

### Pattern B: Intrigue Escalation

Add surprising context that makes the promise MORE compelling than the title alone.

**Example**: Title about a technique -> Open with "What I'm about to show you took professionals years to discover, but you'll learn it in 60 seconds."

**Creates thought**: "This is even better than I expected!"

Works best for: Expert content, reveals, insider knowledge.

### Pattern C: Problem Amplification

Immediately validate why the audience needs this content by amplifying the problem.

**Example**: Title about mistakes -> Open with "If you're doing [X], you're losing [specific bad outcome]."

**Creates thought**: "I need to fix this now!"

Works best for: Problem-solving content, mistake-avoidance content.

### Pattern D: Immediate Value Demonstration

Jump straight into delivering on the promise. No preamble, just results.

**Creates thought**: "This is exactly what I came for!"

Works best for: Tactical content, quick tips, high-value insights.

## Hook Creation Workflow

When creating or reviewing opening hooks, follow this workflow:

1. **Review title/headline** — Understand what curiosity was created
2. **Identify the escalation** — How can the opening make it MORE intriguing?
3. **Choose hook pattern** — Which structure (A/B/C/D) best serves the content?
4. **Draft opening content** — Create the opening section
5. **Apply verification checklist** — Ensure all requirements are met
6. **Test against forbidden patterns** — Ensure none of the 3 forbidden patterns are present

## Voice Application

Before finalizing any written output, invoke the `writing:voice` skill to apply voice rules. Hooks should reflect the user's authentic voice, not generic copywriting language.

## Brand Compliance

When creating assets for The AI Launchpad, invoke `branding-kit:brand-guidelines` to resolve the correct design system and check anti-patterns.

## Quality Verification Checklist

Before finalizing any opening hook, verify ALL of these:

- [ ] **Non-Repetition Test**: Does this opening avoid repeating the title? (Must be YES)
- [ ] **Curiosity Extension Test**: Does this make the audience MORE curious than the title alone?
- [ ] **Direct Connection Test**: Is this immediately related to what the title promised?
- [ ] **No Greeting First Test**: Does this avoid greetings before the hook? (Must be YES)
- [ ] **Attention Increase Test**: Will this INCREASE audience attention, not drain it?
- [ ] **Engagement Validation Test**: Does this confirm the audience made the right choice engaging?
- [ ] **Platform Timing Test**: Does this meet the platform-specific timing/length requirements?

## Common Failure Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Friendly But Empty Greeting
```
Bad: "Hi everyone, welcome! Thanks so much for being here..."
```
**Problem**: Drains attention before value is delivered.

### Pattern 2: The Exact Repetition
```
Bad: Title: "5 AI Agent Patterns"
     Opening: "Today I'm showing you 5 AI agent patterns"
```
**Problem**: Audience already knows this. No new information.

### Pattern 3: The Meandering Start
```
Bad: Title: "Amazing Coding Hack"
     Opening: "So I was browsing GitHub yesterday and I saw
     this interesting repo and it reminded me of..."
```
**Problem**: Takes too long to get to the promised content.

### Pattern 4: The Over-Explanation
```
Bad: "Before we get started, let me explain why this is
     important and give you some background on..."
```
**Problem**: Delays the payoff. Audience loses patience.

## Critical Success Factors

**Priority Order (highest to lowest):**
1. DO NOT repeat the title (instant failure if violated)
2. Extend curiosity beyond the title/headline
3. Connect directly to promised content
4. DO NOT greet before hooking
5. Meet platform-specific timing/length requirements

**CRITICAL**: If the opening repeats the title, greets before hooking, or starts with unrelated content, the hook has FAILED regardless of other qualities. These are disqualifying violations.
