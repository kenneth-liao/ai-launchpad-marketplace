# Research Frameworks Reference

Research methodology patterns, gap analysis frameworks, and templates for conducting content research across any platform.

## Research Methodology: The Four-Phase Approach

1. **Landscape Scan** — Broad survey of what exists on the topic
   - Search 3-5 different queries to cover the topic from multiple angles
   - Note the dominant formats (video, article, thread, newsletter)
   - Identify the major players and recurring creators

2. **Deep Analysis** — Detailed examination of top performers
   - Select 5-8 top-performing pieces for close analysis
   - Document structure, angle, audience reaction, and engagement
   - Note what each piece does well and where it falls short

3. **Pattern Synthesis** — Extract the common threads
   - What angles appear repeatedly? (saturated)
   - What audience questions go unanswered? (gaps)
   - What formats or approaches are underutilized?

4. **Opportunity Mapping** — Rate and recommend
   - Map gaps against audience demand
   - Assess differentiation potential
   - Recommend the highest-impact angle

### Research Query Strategy

Use multiple query variations to prevent blind spots:
- Direct topic: "AI agent memory systems"
- Problem framing: "AI agents forgetting context"
- Solution framing: "persistent memory for AI"
- Audience framing: "developers building AI agents"

## Gap Analysis Framework

### Saturation Assessment

| Level | Description | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Oversaturated | 10+ strong pieces, well-covered | Avoid unless truly unique take |
| Moderately Covered | 5-10 pieces, clear angle gaps | Opportunity for differentiation |
| Lightly Covered | 1-4 pieces, shallow treatment | Strong opportunity, validate demand |
| Uncovered | No meaningful content exists | High opportunity if demand exists |

### Gap Types

- **Depth Gap**: Covered superficially, nobody goes deep
- **Recency Gap**: Existing content is outdated
- **Angle Gap**: Always covered from the same perspective
- **Format Gap**: Covered in one format but not another
- **Audience Gap**: Covered for one level but not another
- **Practical Gap**: Covered theoretically but no real implementation

## Competitor Analysis Template

For each competitor piece, collect:

**Metrics**: Views/reads, engagement rate, publication date, creator audience size

**Content Analysis**:
- **Angle**: What specific approach did they take?
- **Depth**: Surface-level overview or deep dive?
- **Unique Element**: What sets this apart?
- **Weakness**: Where does it fall short?

**Audience Signals**:
- What do comments/replies ask for that was not covered?
- What complaints or criticisms appear?
- Are viewers/readers asking for follow-up content?

## Rating Criteria for Opportunities

***** (High)**: Significant gap, strong demand, clear differentiation, low competition
**** (Medium)**: Moderate gap, some competition, reasonable demand, requires strong execution
*** (Low)**: Minor gap, heavy competition, incremental value over existing content

### Decision Matrix

| Factor | Weight | How to Assess |
|---|---|---|
| Audience Demand | High | Search volume, comment requests, trending signals |
| Competition Level | High | Number and quality of existing content |
| Differentiation | Medium | User's unique angle, expertise, or tools |
| Timeliness | Medium | Trending or evergreen? |
| Production Effort | Low | Tiebreaker only |

## Common Research Pitfalls

1. **Confirmation Bias**: Searching only for evidence that supports a preexisting angle. Explicitly look for competing content.
2. **Recency Bias**: Overweighting recent content and ignoring evergreen pieces that still perform well.
3. **Metrics Without Context**: A video with 1M views from a 10M-subscriber channel is underperforming. Always contextualize.
4. **Surface-Level Gaps**: "Nobody has made a video about X" is not a gap if there is no demand. Validate with audience signals.
5. **Analysis Paralysis**: Set scope (5-8 competitors, 3-5 gaps, one angle), then stop researching and start creating.
