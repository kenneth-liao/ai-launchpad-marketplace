# Substack Notes Strategy

Strategic frameworks, data, and decision models for Substack Notes planning. This is the authoritative source for Notes strategy — the companion writing reference (`writing:copywriting` > `substack-notes.md`) covers templates, formatting, and note structure.

## The Newsletter Publishing Cycle

Structure Notes around each newsletter issue using three phases. Each phase serves a distinct strategic purpose.

### Phase 1: Pre-Newsletter (1-2 days before issue)

**Goal:** Build anticipation, prime engagement, surface early interest signals.

Post types:
- **Teaser note** with a key finding or surprising detail from the upcoming issue
- **Topic poll:** "I'm exploring X for this week's issue — what angle interests you most?"
- **Behind-the-scenes:** What you're researching, a source that surprised you, or a draft excerpt

Example note:
> I've been digging into something counterintuitive for this week's issue. The data says the opposite of what most people assume about [topic]. Publishing Thursday — but here's the part that surprised me most: [one detail].

**Strategic rationale:** Pre-issue Notes create a sense of anticipation and give subscribers a reason to watch for the issue. They also generate replies and restacks that surface your profile to non-subscribers right before your issue drops.

### Phase 2: Issue Day

**Goal:** Drive immediate reads by leading with the insight, not the announcement.

Lead with the most compelling finding or takeaway. The note itself should deliver standalone value — the link is for readers who want the full breakdown.

Good example:
> Most people think [common belief]. After analyzing [data], the reality is the opposite — and it changes how you should approach [topic]. Full breakdown in today's issue: [link]

Bad example:
> New issue just dropped! Check it out: [link]

**Strategic rationale:** Notes that lead with insight get restacked. Notes that lead with "new issue!" get ignored. The first few hours of engagement on an issue determine how Substack's algorithm distributes it to non-subscribers via recommendations and the Notes feed.

### Phase 3: Post-Newsletter (2-5 days after)

**Goal:** Extend the issue's life, re-engage readers, surface new discussion threads.

Post types:
- Share a reader response or interesting reply that adds a new angle
- Post a follow-up question sparked by the issue's topic
- Go deeper on one specific point that deserved more space

Example note:
> Best response to this week's issue came from a reader who tried the exact opposite of what I recommended — and it also worked. Here's why both approaches are valid: [insight]. Original issue for context: [link]

**Strategic rationale:** Not every subscriber reads on day one. Post-issue Notes give the content a second and third window of visibility. They also signal to Substack's algorithm that the conversation around your content is ongoing, which extends recommendation distribution.

## Between-Issues Filler Content

When no issue is in an active cycle, use filler content to maintain presence and audience connection.

| Content Type | Example | Strategic Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Pattern Observation** | "I've noticed the best [niche] people all do..." | Authority building |
| **Quick Tip** | One actionable insight readers can use today | Value delivery |
| **Personal Update** | Process, challenges, wins from your work | Authenticity / connection |
| **Hot Take** | A mildly provocative opinion to spark discussion | High engagement driver |
| **Build-in-Public** | Progress sharing with real numbers | Trust / transparency |
| **Direct Advice** | Clear, specific instruction with reasoning | Audience service |

Filler content keeps your profile active in the Notes feed between issues and prevents subscriber drift.

## Goal-to-Type Mapping

Detailed mapping from strategic goal to recommended note types:

| Goal | Recommended Types | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Teaching** | List-Based Tactical, Problem -> Solution | Structured advice converts into saves and restacks; readers share actionable content |
| **Building Authority** | Pattern Observation, Income Proof Story | Pattern recognition signals expertise without self-promotion; proof stories build credibility |
| **Connection** | Vulnerable Personal Story, Build-in-Public Update | Vulnerability invites empathy; real-time progress creates investment in your journey |
| **Quick Value** | Single-Punch Wisdom, Direct Advice | High shareability with minimal reader time investment; ideal for restacking |
| **Transparency** | Build-in-Public Update | Real numbers and honest timelines build trust faster than polished narratives |
| **Positioning** | Contrarian Statement | Challenges to conventional wisdom are memorable and spark discussion in replies |

## Substack Notes Distribution

How Notes actually spread — different from other platforms:

| # | Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Notes feed** | Notes appear in the Notes tab for your subscribers and people who follow you |
| 2 | **Restack amplification** | When someone restacks your note, it surfaces to their entire subscriber base — this is the primary growth lever |
| 3 | **Reply visibility** | Replying to other writers' Notes surfaces your profile to their audience |
| 4 | **Recommendation algorithm** | Substack recommends Notes from writers similar to ones a reader already follows — engagement signals drive this |
| 5 | **Consistency signal** | Regular posting teaches the algorithm you're an active creator worth surfacing; sporadic posting gets deprioritized |

**Key takeaway:** Restacks are the primary amplification mechanism on Notes. Writing restackable content — standalone insights, quotable observations, useful frameworks — is the single highest-leverage strategy. Engage with other writers' Notes to build reciprocal visibility.

## Posting Cadence

### Optimal Frequency: 3-5 Notes Per Week

| Cadence | Effect |
|---|---|
| < 2/week | Losing visibility between issues; algorithm deprioritizes inactive profiles |
| 3-5/week | Sweet spot — daily on non-newsletter days maintains consistent presence |
| 6-7/week | Acceptable if quality stays high; monitor for engagement drop-off |
| Newsletter day | One strong note with the issue link; additional notes optional |

### Suggested Weekly Mix

| Day | Post Type |
|---|---|
| **Monday** | Pattern Observation or Quick Tip (start the week with value) |
| **Tuesday** | Pre-newsletter teaser or poll (if issue publishes Wed/Thu) |
| **Wednesday/Thursday** | Issue-day note with key takeaway + link |
| **Friday** | Post-issue follow-up or reader response highlight |
| **Weekend** | Personal update or Build-in-Public (casual tone matches weekend browsing) |

Adjust based on your newsletter schedule — always align the teaser with 1-2 days before your issue and the follow-up with 2-5 days after.

### Timing

- **Morning (7-9am):** Best for polls and questions — people engage while starting their day
- **Early afternoon (12-2pm):** Best for insights and tactical content — focused reading time
- **Align with audience:** If your analytics show a different peak, follow the data over general advice

## Cross-Platform Synergy

Notes work best as part of a multi-platform content system. Each direction serves a different strategic purpose:

| Direction | How | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Notes -> Twitter/X** | Adapt a high-performing note into a tweet; adjust for Twitter's tone | Expand reach beyond the Substack ecosystem |
| **YouTube -> Notes** | Pull an interesting detail or finding from a video + include link | Drive Substack subscribers to video content |
| **Newsletter -> Notes** | Post key finding as standalone note, teaser before, follow-up after | Extend issue lifespan and drive reads |
| **LinkedIn -> Notes** | Reframe a professional insight for the Substack audience | Bridge professional and creator audiences |

When cross-promoting, always lead with standalone value. The note should be worth reading even if the reader never clicks a link.

## The 80/20 Rule

**80% of notes should deliver standalone value. 20% can be promotional.** Over-promoting destroys trust and trains subscribers to skip your Notes. This ratio is non-negotiable for long-term growth.

What counts as promotional: newsletter link drops, product mentions, course CTAs, affiliate links.

What counts as value: insights, observations, tips, stories, questions, personal updates — anything a reader benefits from without clicking away.

## Measurement

Track these metrics to evaluate Notes performance:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| **Restacks** | Primary amplification signal — are people sharing your notes with their audience? |
| **Replies** | Depth of engagement — are notes sparking genuine conversation? |
| **Subscriber growth** | Are Notes converting non-subscribers? This is the bottom-line metric |
| **Click-through** | For teaser and promo notes — are readers clicking to the full content? |

**Review cadence:** Weekly. Identify which note types get the most restacks and replies. Double down on what works. Cut what doesn't. Track subscriber growth trends against posting consistency to confirm your cadence is driving results.
