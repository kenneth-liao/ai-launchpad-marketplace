# YouTube Community Post Strategy

Strategic frameworks, data, and decision models for YouTube community post planning. This is the authoritative source for community post strategy — the companion writing reference (`writing:copywriting` > `youtube-community-post.md`) covers templates, formatting, and post structure.

## The 3-Phase Video Cycle

Structure community posts around each video upload using three phases. Each phase serves a distinct strategic purpose.

### Phase 1: Pre-Release (1-3 days before upload)

**Goal:** Build anticipation, prime the algorithm, gather early engagement signals.

Post types:
- **Teaser image or clip** with a cryptic or curiosity-driven caption
- **Topic poll:** "I'm deciding between X and Y for my next video. Which do you want?"
- **Behind-the-scenes:** Photo of setup, script notes, or a hint about the topic

Example post:
> I just tested something wild for the upcoming video. Let's just say... the results were NOT what I expected. Any guesses what I tried?

**Strategic rationale:** Pre-release posts create an engagement signal that primes the recommendation system before the video goes live. The algorithm sees an active, engaged audience and is more likely to distribute the video on launch.

### Phase 2: Launch Day

**Goal:** Drive immediate views and engagement to trigger algorithmic distribution.

Post types:
- **Hook-first promotion** — lead with intrigue, not "new video out"
- Include the video link with a compelling reason to click

Good example:
> I spent 2 weeks building an AI agent that runs my entire email inbox. It saved me 6 hours a week — but almost sent a very embarrassing reply to my boss. Full breakdown: [link]

Bad example:
> New video is live! Check it out: [link]

**Strategic rationale:** The first few hours of a video's life determine its algorithmic trajectory. A community post that drives immediate clicks from engaged subscribers sends a strong signal to YouTube's recommendation system.

### Phase 3: Post-Launch (3-7 days after)

**Goal:** Resurface the video for subscribers who missed it, extend its reach.

Post types:
- Share an interesting comment or frequently asked question from the video
- Post a follow-up poll related to the video's topic
- Share a key takeaway as a standalone tip

Example post:
> The #1 question from my last video: "Does this work with [tool]?" Short answer: yes, with one tweak. Here's the 30-second version: [tip]. Full walkthrough in the video: [link]

**Strategic rationale:** Not all subscribers see a video at launch. Post-launch posts give the video a second chance at distribution and keep the conversation going, which feeds back into the algorithm.

## Between-Videos Filler Content

When no video is in an active cycle, use filler content to maintain engagement signals and audience connection.

| Content Type | Example | Strategic Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Audience research poll** | "What's your biggest frustration with AI tools right now?" | Content planning data |
| **Quick tip** | One actionable insight from your niche (150-250 chars) | Value delivery |
| **Personal update** | Something real about your process, challenges, or wins | Authenticity / connection |
| **Meme/humor** | Relatable niche humor | Personality / shareability |
| **Fan shout-out** | Highlight a great comment or community member | Community building |
| **Hot take** | A mildly provocative opinion to spark discussion | High engagement driver |

Filler content keeps the channel's algorithm signals alive between uploads and prevents audience drift.

## Algorithm Impact

Community posts affect YouTube's recommendation system in five documented ways:

| # | Effect | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Channel activity signal** | Regular posts tell YouTube the channel is active and engaged |
| 2 | **Home feed distribution** | High-engagement posts reach non-subscribers via the algorithmic Home feed — a well-performing poll can reach tens of thousands of non-subscribers |
| 3 | **Returning viewer rate** | Consistent posting boosts returning viewer rates by 15-18% |
| 4 | **Sustained cadence > sporadic bursts** | The algorithm rewards consistency over volume |
| 5 | **Pre-video priming** | A high-engagement post before a video upload signals audience interest to the recommendation system |

**Key takeaway:** Community posts are not just audience engagement tools — they are algorithmic levers. A consistent posting cadence directly affects how YouTube distributes the channel's videos.

## Posting Cadence

### Optimal Frequency: 2-3 Posts Per Week

| Cadence | Effect |
|---|---|
| < 1/week | Losing connection between uploads; algorithm signals drop |
| 2-3/week | Sweet spot for consistency without fatigue |
| 4-5/week | Acceptable for very active channels; monitor for engagement drop |
| 6+/week | Risk of viewer fatigue and algorithmic throttling |
| During launches | Daily posting is acceptable for 2-3 days |

### Suggested Weekly Mix

| Day | Post Type |
|---|---|
| **Monday/Tuesday** | Engagement poll or audience question |
| **Wednesday/Thursday** | Value post (tip, behind-the-scenes, or image) |
| **Friday/Saturday** | Video promotion or teaser for upcoming content |

Adjust based on the upload schedule — always align the promotional post with the video release.

## Timing Strategies

### General Best Windows

- **Late morning to early afternoon:** 12-3pm in the audience's primary timezone
- **Early evening:** 5-8pm
- **Morning polls:** 7-9am (people like to vote while starting their day)
- **Best days:** Thursday and Friday tend to see higher engagement

### Analytics-Based Timing

Use **YouTube Studio > Analytics > Audience** to find when the specific subscriber base is online. Post when 50-70% of the audience is active. This always outperforms general timing advice.

## The Poll-to-Video Pipeline

The highest-conversion strategy for community posts is the audience feedback loop:

```
Poll ("Which topic?")
  -> Audience votes
    -> Make the winning video
      -> Announce results in post
        -> Viewers feel invested -> watch
          -> Repeat
```

**Why it works:**
- Audience feels ownership over the content
- Built-in anticipation and commitment before the video exists
- Natural engagement loop that compounds over time
- Provides real audience data for content planning (not guesswork)

This pipeline combines the pre-release phase of the 3-Phase Video Cycle with audience research, creating a self-reinforcing content planning system.

## Conversion Best Practices

Community posts are underutilized for driving conversions. Because they don't interrupt the viewing experience, they can outperform in-video CTAs for certain conversion types:

| Conversion Type | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Affiliate links** | Soft-sell with context: "I use this daily, here's my link" |
| **Memberships** | Exclusive poll results or early access teasers |
| **Products/Merch** | Image posts with real usage photos |
| **Email/Newsletter signups** | "I share deeper breakdowns in my newsletter -> [link]" |
| **Course/Workshop promotion** | Behind-the-scenes of creation process -> CTA |

### The 80/20 Rule

**80% of posts should be engagement/value. 20% can be promotional.** Over-commercializing destroys community trust and causes unfollows. This ratio is non-negotiable for long-term channel health.

## Measurement Framework

Track these six metrics in YouTube Studio to evaluate community post performance:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| **Impressions** | How widely the post was distributed |
| **Engagement rate** | Likes + comments + votes / impressions |
| **Poll votes** | Direct interaction count |
| **Comments** | Depth of engagement |
| **Link clicks** | Conversion effectiveness (for promo posts) |
| **Subscriber change** | Posts driving new subscriptions |

**Review cadence:** Weekly. Double down on what's working. Cut what isn't.
